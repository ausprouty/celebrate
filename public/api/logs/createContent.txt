<p class="reference">Luke 18:18-30</p>

<p><sup>18</sup>A certain ruler asked him, &ldquo;Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>&ldquo;Why do you call me good?&rdquo; Jesus answered. &ldquo;No one is good&mdash;except God alone.<sup> 20&nbsp; </sup>You know the commandments: &lsquo;You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup>21</sup>&ldquo;All these I have kept since I was a boy,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p><sup>22</sup>When Jesus heard this, he said to him, &ldquo;You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup>23</sup>When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was very wealthy.<sup> 24&nbsp; </sup>Jesus looked at him and said, &ldquo;How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!<sup>25</sup>Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup>26</sup>Those who heard this asked, &ldquo;Who then can be saved?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup>27</sup>Jesus replied, &ldquo;What is impossible with man is possible with God.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup>28</sup>Peter said to him, &ldquo;We have left all we had to follow you!&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup>29</sup>&ldquo;Truly I tell you,&rdquo; Jesus said to them, &ldquo;no one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God<sup> 30&nbsp; </sup>will fail to receive many times as much in this age, and in the age to come eternal life.&rdquo;</p>

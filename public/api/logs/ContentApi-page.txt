Forgive me, where I trusted my experiences more than Your Word and\r\n    thus have acted in unbelief. Train me so I can grow in faith. I want to\r\n    learn to see things from Your perspective in every situation, to focus on\r\n    what happens in the spiritual realm and not the visible realm. Help me to\r\n    understand Your Word and Your perspective more and more.”\r\n  <\/p>\r\n  <div class=\"lesson\">\r\n    <img class=\"lesson-icon\" src=\"\/images\/compass\/background.png\" \/>\r\n    <div class=\"lesson-subtitle\">SCRIPTURE COMMENTS<\/div>\r\n  <\/div>\r\n  <p>\r\n    Faith means that we accept and proclaim what God thinks about a situation\r\n    and what is possible for him. Because to have faith means to know that the\r\n    visible realm – our limitations, experiences, sorrows – are not the only\r\n    reality. The spiritual realm is the place where the script for your life is\r\n    written. The visible realm is only what happens on the screen. Abraham\r\n    showed us what faith is. He had to wait a really long time before he could\r\n    have a son. All aspects of Abraham’s and Sarah’s lives had long been\r\n    indicating that they would not be able get a son. But Abraham persisted and\r\n    put his trust in God and His promise.\r\n  <\/p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    To us, God’s Word, the written and living Word (Jesus), is the crucial tool\r\n    for us to grow in faith. Because it transmits the real truth about...\r\n  <\/p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n      …what God is like – He for whom everything is possible, who fights for us,\r\n      who hears the cries of our hearts (Psalm 34:7), our provider, prince of\r\n      peace, doctor, shelter, wisdom, beginning and the end, and so on.\r\n    <\/li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      …and what he did for us – we are accepted, loved, his children, envoys, he\r\n      made us kings and priests, and so on.\r\n    <\/li>\r\n  <\/ul>\r\n  <p>Steps to faith:<\/p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>God’s Word: Know who God is and what He did for us.<\/li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      Prayer: Proclaim this over you or a situation you’re in (“Heavenly Father,\r\n      you are…” and “in your eyes, I am…”).\r\n    <\/li>\r\n  <\/ol>\r\n  <p>\r\n    Remember. If we hear God’s word (even from our own lips) and hold on to it\r\n    perseveringly, it will bring fruit. It will release faith for God’s plans in\r\n    our lives (Romans 10:14; Luke 8:15).\r\n  <\/p>\r\n  <br \/>\r\n  <br \/>\r\n<\/html>\r\n"}}

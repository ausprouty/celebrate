<p>Watch the JESUS film (available at <a href="https://www.jesusfilm.org/watch/jesus.html/english.html">jesusfilm.org/watch.html</a>)</p>

<br /><p>This is an accurate depiction of the life, teaching and suffering of Jesus. There are
three ways you can decide to watch this film:</p>
<ul>
<li> As a historic film: In this case everything shown in the film becomes a story that
happened 2000 years ago and has no relevance for us nowadays.</li>
<li> As the salvation of humanity: If you watch the film from this point of view, then
Jesus died for the sins of the entire human race and it does not really concern
me much since I am just one in billions.</li>
<li> As the price for MY salvation: If we watch the film from the point of view that
Jesus suff ered for ME personally, then we will be able to understand what really
happened. It is important to make ourselves aware again and again that this
film is about US. Someone suffered the worst torture to free ME from the power
of evil and to make me free to choose God’s way again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Decide how much of the movie you will watch together. If you do not have time for
the entire movie consider starting at the one hour mark. This will give still give you
examples of Jesus teaching and miracles before He goes to Jerusalem to suff er and
die.</p>

<!-- begin bible --><p><sup class="myfriends_versenum">25 </sup>“Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;26 </sup>Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;27 </sup>Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?</p> <p><sup class="myfriends_versenum">28 </sup>“And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;29 </sup>Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;30 </sup>If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith?<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;31 </sup>So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;32 </sup>For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;33 </sup>But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;34 </sup>Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</p>

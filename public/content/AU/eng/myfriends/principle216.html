Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.’</p><p><sup class="myfriends_versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>“The manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I’m not strong enough to dig, and I’m ashamed to beg—<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</sup>I know what I’ll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses.’</p><p><sup class="myfriends_versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>“So he called in each one of his master’s debtors. He asked the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’</p><p><sup class="myfriends_versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>“‘Nine hundred gallons of olive oil,’ he replied.</p><p>“The manager told him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred and fifty.’</p><p><sup class="myfriends_versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>“Then he asked the second, ‘And how much do you owe?’</p><p>“‘A thousand bushels of wheat,’ he replied.</p><p>“He told him, ‘Take your bill and make it eight hundred.’</p><p><sup class="myfriends_versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>“The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</sup>I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.</p><p><sup class="myfriends_versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>“Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</sup>So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches?<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</sup>And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else’s property, who will give you property of your own?</p><p><sup class="myfriends_versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>“No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.”</p><p><sup class="myfriends_versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</sup>He said to them, “You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in God’s sight.</p><br /><a class="bible_readmore" href="https://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2016:1-15&amp;version=NIV">Read More</a><br /><br /></div></div>

      <p class="myfriends-reference">Luke 16:1-15</p>
      <p>
        <sup >1</sup>Jesus told his disciples: “There
        was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions.<sup
          
          >2</sup
        >So he called him in and asked him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give
        an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any
        longer.’
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >3</sup>“The manager said to himself,
        ‘What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I’m not strong
        enough to dig, and I’m ashamed to beg—<sup 
          >4</sup
        >I know what I’ll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will
        welcome me into their houses.’
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >5</sup>“So he called in each one of his
        master’s debtors. He asked the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >6</sup>“‘Nine hundred gallons of olive
        oil,’ he replied.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The manager told him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it
        four hundred and fifty.’
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >7</sup>“Then he asked the second, ‘And
        how much do you owe?’
      </p>
      <p>“‘A thousand bushels of wheat,’ he replied.</p>
      <p>“He told him, ‘Take your bill and make it eight hundred.’</p>
      <p>
        <sup >8</sup>“The master commended the
        dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this
        world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people
        of the light.<sup >9</sup>I tell you, use
        worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone,
        you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >10</sup>“Whoever can be trusted with
        very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with
        very little will also be dishonest with much.<sup
          
          >11</sup
        >So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who
        will trust you with true riches?<sup >12</sup
        >And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else’s property, who
        will give you property of your own?
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >13</sup>“No one can serve two masters.
        Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted
        to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >14</sup>The Pharisees, who loved money,
        heard all this and were sneering at Jesus.<sup
          
          >15</sup
        >He said to them, “You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes
        of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is
        detestable in God’s sight.

        To stop evil from spreading uncontrollably, as was the case before the
        flood, God set boundaries to keep individualism and egotism in check.
        The most important rules are called the “Ten Commandments”. These rules
        help us to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour.
        They are the basis for punishing mistakes to prevent evil from spreading
        unhindered and infecting the whole human race. They reveal our own
        brokenness in relationship with God (First five) and each other (second
        five).

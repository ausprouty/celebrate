<!-- begin bible --><p><sup class="myfriends_versenum">11 </sup>Jesus continued: “There was a man who had two sons.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;12 </sup>The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the estate.’ So he divided his property between them.</p> <p><sup class="myfriends_versenum">13 </sup>“Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;14 </sup>After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;15 </sup>So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;16 </sup>He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.</p> <p><sup class="myfriends_versenum">17 </sup>“When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death!<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;18 </sup>I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;19 </sup>I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.’<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;20 </sup>So he got up and went to his father.</p><p>“But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.</p> <p><sup class="myfriends_versenum">21 </sup>“The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’</p> <p><sup class="myfriends_versenum">22 </sup>“But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;23 </sup>Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;24 </sup>For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ So they began to celebrate.</p> <p><sup class="myfriends_versenum">25 </sup>“Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;26 </sup>So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;27 </sup>‘Your brother has come,’ he replied, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.’</p> <p><sup class="myfriends_versenum">28 </sup>“The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;29 </sup>But he answered his father, ‘Look! All these years I’ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;30 </sup>But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!’</p> <p><sup class="myfriends_versenum">31 </sup>“‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;32 </sup>But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’”</p>

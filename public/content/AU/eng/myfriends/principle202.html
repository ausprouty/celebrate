        <sup>9</sup>To some who were confident of their own
        righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this
        parable:<sup >10</sup>“Two men went up to the
        temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.<sup
          
        >
          11&nbsp; </sup
        >The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am
        not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this
        tax collector.<sup >12</sup>I fast twice a
        week and give a tenth of all I get.’
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >13</sup>“But the tax collector stood at
        a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and
        said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >14</sup>“I tell you that this man,
        rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who
        exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will
        be exalted.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >15</sup>People were also bringing babies
        to Jesus for him to place his hands on them. When the disciples saw
        this, they rebuked them.<sup > 16&nbsp; </sup
        >But Jesus called the children to him and said, “Let the little children
        come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to
        such as these.<sup >17</sup>Truly I tell you,
        anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will
        never enter it.”

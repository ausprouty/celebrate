      <p>
        <sup>19</sup>“There was a rich man who was dressed in
        purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.<sup
          
          >20</sup
        >At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores<sup
          
          >21</sup
        >and longing to eat what fell from the rich man’s table. Even the dogs
        came and licked his sores.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >22</sup>“The time came when the beggar
        died and the angels carried him to Abraham’s side. The rich man also
        died and was buried.<sup >23</sup>In Hades,
        where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with
        Lazarus by his side.<sup >24</sup>So he called
        to him, ‘Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip
        of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this
        fire.’
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >25</sup>“But Abraham replied, ‘Son,
        remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while
        Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in
        agony.<sup >26</sup>And besides all this,
        between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so that those
        who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from
        there to us.’
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >27</sup>“He answered, ‘Then I beg you,
        father, send Lazarus to my family,<sup 
          >28</sup
        >for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also
        come to this place of torment.’
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >29</sup>“Abraham replied, ‘They have
        Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.’
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >30</sup>“‘No, father Abraham,’ he said,
        ‘but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.’
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >31</sup>“He said to him, ‘If they do not
        listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if
        someone rises from the dead.’”

      <p class="reference">Luke 18:18-30</p>
      <p>
        <sup>18</sup>A certain ruler asked him, “Good teacher,
        what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >19</sup>“Why do you call me good?” Jesus
        answered. “No one is good—except God alone.<sup
          
        >
          20&nbsp; </sup
        >You know the commandments: ‘You shall not commit adultery, you shall
        not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony,
        honor your father and mother.’”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >21</sup>“All these I have kept since I
        was a boy,” he said.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >22</sup>When Jesus heard this, he said
        to him, “You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to
        the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >23</sup>When he heard this, he became
        very sad, because he was very wealthy.<sup >
          24&nbsp; </sup
        >Jesus looked at him and said, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the
        kingdom of God!<sup >25</sup>Indeed, it is
        easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone
        who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >26</sup>Those who heard this asked, “Who
        then can be saved?”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >27</sup>Jesus replied, “What is
        impossible with man is possible with God.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >28</sup>Peter said to him, “We have left
        all we had to follow you!”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >29</sup>“Truly I tell you,” Jesus said
        to them, “no one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters or
        parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God<sup
          
        >
          30&nbsp; </sup
        >will fail to receive many times as much in this age, and in the age to
        come eternal life.”

      <p>
        <sup>29</sup>But he wanted to justify himself, so he
        asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >30</sup>In reply Jesus said: “A man was
        going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers.
        They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him
        half dead.<sup >31</sup>A priest happened to
        be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on
        the other side.<sup > 32&nbsp; </sup>So too, a
        Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other
        side.<sup >33</sup>But a Samaritan, as he
        traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on
        him.<sup >34</sup>He went to him and bandaged
        his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own
        donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him.<sup
          
          >35</sup
        >The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper.
        ‘Look after him,’ he said, ‘and when I return, I will reimburse you for
        any extra expense you may have.’
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >36</sup>“Which of these three do you
        think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >37</sup>The expert in the law replied,
        “The one who had mercy on him.”
      </p>
      <p>Jesus told him, “Go and do likewise.”</p>

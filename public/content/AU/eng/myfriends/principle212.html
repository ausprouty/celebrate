Then come, follow me.”</p> <p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>At this the man’s face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.</p> <p><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!”</p> <p><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, “Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</sup>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”</p> <p><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, “Who then can be saved?”</p> <p><sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God.”</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>“Why do you call me good?” Jesus answered. “No one is good—except God alone.<sup class="myfriends-versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>You know the commandments: ‘You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, you shall not defraud, honor your father and mother.’”</p> <p><sup class="myfriends-versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>“Teacher,” he declared, “all these I have kept since I was a boy.”</p> <p><sup class="myfriends-versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>Jesus looked at him and loved him. “One thing you lack,” he said. “Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”</p> <p><sup class="myfriends-versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>At this the man’s face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.</p> <p><sup class="myfriends-versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!”</p> <p><sup class="myfriends-versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, “Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!<sup class="myfriends-versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”</p> <p><sup class="myfriends-versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, “Who then can be saved?”</p> <p><sup class="myfriends-versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God.”</p>

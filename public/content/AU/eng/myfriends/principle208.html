      <p>
        <sup>21</sup>“You have heard that it was said to the
        people long ago, ‘You shall not murder, and anyone who murders will be
        subject to judgment.’<sup >22</sup>But I tell
        you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to
        judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‘Raca,’ is
        answerable to the court. And anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be in
        danger of the fire of hell.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >23</sup>“Therefore, if you are offering
        your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister
        has something against you,<sup >
          24&nbsp; </sup
        >leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled
        to them; then come and offer your gift.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >25</sup>“Settle matters quickly with
        your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still
        together on the way, or your adversary may hand you over to the judge,
        and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown
        into prison.<sup >26</sup>Truly I tell you,
        you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.

<!-- begin bible --><p><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>“Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them.<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</sup>To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</sup>The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more.<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</sup>So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more.<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</sup>But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money.</p> <p><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>“After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</sup>The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.’</p> <p><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>“His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’</p> <p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>“The man with two bags of gold also came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.’</p> <p><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>“His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’</p> <p><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>“Then the man who had received one bag of gold came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed.<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</sup>So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.’</p> <p><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>“His master replied, ‘You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed?<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</sup>Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.</p> <p><sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>“‘So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags.<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</sup>For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</sup>And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’</p>

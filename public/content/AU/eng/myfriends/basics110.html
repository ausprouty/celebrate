<p class="myfriends-lesson_start" dir="ltr">The following Bible study is about baptism. Because the term “baptism” has many different uses nowadays, it’s important that we explain what is meant by the word “baptism”.</p><p dir="ltr">Different people will mean different things when they use the word “baptism”. Here are some examples:</p><ul dir="ltr"><li>Asking God’s blessing for a child</li><li>Washing off original sin</li><li>Defining your religious affiliation</li><li>Naming a child</li><li>Ceremony for instating godfather / godmother</li></ul><p dir="ltr">All of these baptism “types” have a place in their own right, but that is not what is meant here by baptism. In our Bible passage for today, baptism means “identification” or “participation in”.</p><p dir="ltr">Jesus was baptised in the Jordan River. His disciples baptised adults who wanted to identify with His message. Baptism is more than getting wet. In this lesson we’ll be looking at what the Bible says about the significance of baptism.</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p></div>

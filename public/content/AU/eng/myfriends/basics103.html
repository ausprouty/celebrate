        The extreme eff ects of the events in the garden of Eden were gradually

          In the second generation of humans’ individualism and egotism and
          envy, in short sin, was already so advanced that Cain murdered his
          younger brother. He was expelled from his family as a punishment.

          By the tenth generation (Noah’s generation), it needed to be said that
          the wickedness of humans was GREAT. So great, that they could only do
          evil (Genesis 6:11-12). Therefore God decided to intervene
          dramatically in the history of the world to check that evil by only
          allowing what was good to survive the flood and thus make way for a
          new beginning (Genesis 6 and 7).

They don’t wash their hands before they eat!”</p><p><sup class="myfriends-myfriends_versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Jesus replied, “And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?<sup class="myfriends-myfriends_versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’ and ‘Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.’<sup class="myfriends-myfriends_versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is ‘devoted to God,’<sup class="myfriends-myfriends_versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>they are not to ‘honor their father or mother’ with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.<sup class="myfriends-myfriends_versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>You hypocrites!

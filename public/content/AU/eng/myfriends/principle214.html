      <p class="myfriends-reference">Matthew 15:1-20</p>
      <p>
        <sup >1</sup>Then some Pharisees and teachers
        of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked,<sup
          
          >2</sup
        >“Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don’t
        wash their hands before they eat!”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >3</sup>Jesus replied, “And why do you
        break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?<sup
          
          >4</sup
        >For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’ and ‘Anyone who curses
        their father or mother is to be put to death.’<sup
          
          >5</sup
        >But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to
        help their father or mother is ‘devoted to God,’<sup
          
          >6</sup
        >they are not to ‘honor their father or mother’ with it. Thus you
        nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.<sup
          
          >7</sup
        >You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:
      </p>
      <div class="myfriends-poetry top-05">
        <p>
          <sup >8</sup>“‘These people honor me with
          their lips,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but their hearts are far from
          me.<br /><sup >9</sup>They worship me in
          vain;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their teachings are merely human
          rules.’”
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        <sup >10</sup>Jesus called the crowd to him
        and said, “Listen and understand.<sup >11</sup
        >What goes into someone’s mouth does not defile them, but what comes out
        of their mouth, that is what defiles them.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >12</sup>Then the disciples came to him
        and asked, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard
        this?”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >13</sup>He replied, “Every plant that my
        heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots.<sup
          
          >14</sup
        >Leave them; they are blind guides. If the blind lead the blind, both
        will fall into a pit.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >15</sup>Peter said, “Explain the parable
        to us.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >16</sup>“Are you still so dull?” Jesus
        asked them.<sup >17</sup>“Don’t you see that
        whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the
        body?<sup >18</sup>But the things that come
        out of a person’s mouth come from the heart, and these defile them.<sup
          
          >19</sup
        >For out of the heart come evil thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual
        immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.<sup
          
          >20</sup
        >These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not
        defile them.”

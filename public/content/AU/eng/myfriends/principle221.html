      <p>
        <sup >1</sup>That same day Jesus went out of
        the house and sat by the lake.<sup >2</sup
        >Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat
        in it, while all the people stood on the shore.<sup
          
          >3</sup
        >Then he told them many things in parables, saying: “A farmer went out
        to sow his seed.<sup >4</sup>As he was
        scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and
        ate it up.<sup >5</sup>Some fell on rocky
        places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because
        the soil was shallow.<sup >6</sup>But when the
        sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they
        had no root.<sup >7</sup>Other seed fell among
        thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.<sup
          
          >8</sup
        >Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred,
        sixty or thirty times what was sown.<sup 
          >9</sup
        >Whoever has ears, let them hear.”

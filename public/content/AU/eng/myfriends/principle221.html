It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</sup>But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</sup>Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</sup>Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</sup>Whoever has ears, let them hear.”</p><br /><a class="bible_readmore" href="https://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013:1-9&amp;version=NIV">Read More</a><br /><br /></div></div>

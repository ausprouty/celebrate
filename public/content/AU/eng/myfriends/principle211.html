<!-- begin bible --><p><sup class="myfriends_versenum">9 </sup>To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable:<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;10 </sup>“Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;11 </sup>The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.<sup class="myfriends_versenum">&nbsp;12 </sup>I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’</p> <p><sup class="myfriends_versenum">13 </sup>“But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’</p> <p><sup class="myfriends_versenum">14 </sup>“I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”</p>

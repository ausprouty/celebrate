      <p style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">
        Even though Jesus’ death and resurrection paid for the sins of all
        people throughout all history, it does not mean that sins are forgiven
        automatically. Jesus created the possibility for forgiveness which we
        can now receive.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">
        In order for our sins to be forgiven, we need to do two things:
      </p>
      <ol style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">
        <li>Ask God for forgiveness</li>
        <li>Forgive other people</li>
      </ol>
      <p style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">
        When God forgives us, He no longer counts our sins against us because
        Jesus suff ered and died for us. He took the consequences of our sins
        which we should have suff ered ourselves so that we can become free. On
        the basis of this fact, God no longer charges us with guilt, although we
        are guilty, pardoning us instead. Although we are actually guilty we are
        declared righteous by God. That forms the basis for our reconciliation
        with God. What a privilege!
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">
        When we forgive people who have sinned against us, it does not mean that
        we forget, deny or gloss over what happened. In this context “forgiving”
        means letting go. We can hand over the whole thing to God for Him to
        deal with. When we forgive someone and thus hand the whole thing over to
        God, we and our relationship with that person are freed from the burden
        of that sin. We no longer need to bear a grudge. Instead we are able to
        live unburdened and interact with that person because there is no longer
        any guilt between us.

        <sup>26</sup>He also said, “This is what the kingdom of
        God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground.<sup >
          27
        </sup>Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and
        grows, though he does not know how.<sup >
          28
        </sup>All by itself the soil produces grain—first the stalk, then the
        head, then the full kernel in the head.<sup >
          29
        </sup>As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because
        the harvest has come.”
      </p>

        <sup >30</sup>
        <span class="normal">
          Again he said, “What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what
          parable shall we use to describe it?

        <sup >31</sup>
        <span class="normal">
          It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds on

      <p>
        <sup >33</sup>With many similar parables Jesus
        spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand.<sup >
          34
        </sup>He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when
        he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.

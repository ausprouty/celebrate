      <p>
        <sup>3</sup>The teachers of the law and the Pharisees
        brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the
        group<sup >4</sup>and said to Jesus, “Teacher,
        this woman was caught in the act of adultery.<sup
          
        >
          5&nbsp; </sup
        >In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you
        say?”<sup >6</sup>They were using this
        question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his
        finger.<sup > 7&nbsp; </sup>When they kept on
        questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let any one of
        you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.”<sup
          
          >8</sup
        >Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >9</sup>At this, those who heard began to
        go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left,
        with the woman still standing there.<sup >
          10&nbsp; </sup
        >Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one
        condemned you?”
      </p>
      <p><sup >11</sup>“No one, sir,” she said.</p>
      <p>
        “Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Go now and leave your
        life of sin.”

        Let’s be honest. Are you able to keep the Ten Commandments or are you
        aware of persistently breaking them? These rules may be able to fight
        evil, but they cannot completely eradicate it. It remains a fact that we
        humans are not free from evil and that we are not able to change
        ourselves.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        That is why God spoke of a time in which there will be a new way of
        living. But some things need to change for that to happen:
      </p>
      <ol dir="ltr">
        <li>
          When we humans decided against God and chose to follow the snake, we
          had to leave the garden and thus the close relationship with God. We
          have sinned against God and we cannot reverse it. But because God
          loves us so much, He announced that He will forgive our sins. That is
          the most important requirement for getting the kind of relationship
          the first humans had with God.
        </li>
        <li>
          God needs to change our heart so that we are no longer under the
          influence of evil and can choose freely between God and the snake
          (evil). If we choose God and thus what is good, God’s rules will apply
          to us again, but if we choose to listen to the snake we will fall
          under the influence of evil again. But for us to be able to make such
          a decision, we first need to know God (get to know Him). So God spoke
          of a time when everyone will be able know Him personally. When we are
          able to have such a relationship with God, we no longer need to follow
          the rules of a book, instead God will write His rules directly into
          our hearts so that it becomes a part of us.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then we will belong to His people and He will be our God and many
          things will become what God intended them to be in the first place.
        </li>

      <p class="myfriends-reference">Matthew 18:21-35</p>
      <p>
        <sup>21</sup>Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, “Lord,
        how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me?
        Up to seven times?”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >22</sup>Jesus answered, “I tell you, not
        seven times, but seventy-seven times.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >23</sup>“Therefore, the kingdom of
        heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his
        servants.<sup > 24&nbsp; </sup>As he began the
        settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold was brought to
        him.<sup > 25&nbsp; </sup>Since he was not
        able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children
        and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >26</sup>“At this the servant fell on his
        knees before him. ‘Be patient with me,’ he begged, ‘and I will pay back
        everything.’<sup >27</sup>The servant’s master
        took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >28</sup>“But when that servant went out,
        he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins.
        He grabbed him and began to choke him. ‘Pay back what you owe me!’ he
        demanded.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >29</sup>“His fellow servant fell to his
        knees and begged him, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.’
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >30</sup>“But he refused. Instead, he
        went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the
        debt.<sup >31</sup>When the other servants saw
        what had happened, they were outraged and went and told their master
        everything that had happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >32</sup>“Then the master called the
        servant in. ‘You wicked servant,’ he said, ‘I canceled all that debt of
        yours because you begged me to.<sup >
          33&nbsp; </sup
        >Shouldn’t you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on
        you?’<sup >34</sup>In anger his master handed
        him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he
        owed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >35</sup>“This is how my heavenly Father
        will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from
        your heart.”

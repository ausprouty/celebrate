        <sup>27</sup>“But to you who are listening I say: Love
        your enemies, do good to those who hate you,<sup
          
        >
          28&nbsp; </sup

          29&nbsp; </sup
        >If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If
        someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them.<sup
          
        >
          30&nbsp; </sup
        >Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you,
        do not demand it back.<sup >
          31&nbsp; </sup
        >Do to others as you would have them do to you.

        what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them.<sup

        >And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to
        you? Even sinners do that.<sup >34</sup>And if
        you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to
        you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full.
        <sup >35</sup>But love your enemies, do good
        to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then
        your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High,
        because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.<sup

<h2 class="back">Motivation and Encouragement</h2>

<p>The Lord not only loves us, He has a vision for our lives. What is that vision? It is to be like Christ. Romans 8:29 says that His plan is that we all conform to the image of Christ, to experience and reflect the Father like Christ did. And the great news is that this work of Christlikeness is God&rsquo;s work. Philippians 1:6 promises that He who began this good work in you, will be faithful to complete it! Be encouraged that God will work in your life to become like Christ.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p>A follower of Jesus named Philip had been sharing the gospel with people in an area of Israel called Samaria. The Lord interrupted his ministry and told him to go south along the road leading toward Egypt. When he arrived, he found an African leader who was traveling back to his home country. This story tells us what happened.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p>Read Matthew 3:13-17. Jesus himself was baptized and modelled it to His followers. Ever since the time of Christ, everyone who begins to follow Him has made this commitment. Our willingness to be baptized shows others that there has been a real change in our lives. It symbolizes our bold identification with the death and resurrection of Jesus (Romans 6:4-5).&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="forward">Preparing for Mission</h2>

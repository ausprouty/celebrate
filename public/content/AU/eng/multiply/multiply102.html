<p>When we accept Christ, our lives are changed forever. 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, anyone who belongs to Christ is a new creation, the old life has gone, and a new life has begun! That&rsquo;s us! We are new creations and as we follow Christ, our lives will continue to change to be full of purpose and meaning. Let&rsquo;s encourage each other with this truth as we journey together in this new life.</p>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p>Those who are looked down on in society had been responding to Jesus&rsquo; teaching. The religious leaders (Pharisees) and the teachers of the religious law didn&rsquo;t like Jesus associating with these people. So Jesus told a story about a lost son to explain God&rsquo;s heart towards sinners.</p>

<h2 class="up">Read</h2>

<div id="bible">
<div class="bible">
<p>Read or watch <strong>Luke 15:11-24 </strong>&nbsp;two times as everyone listens</p>

<h2 class="up">Discovery Discussion</h2>

<ul class="up">
	<li>Everyone tells what caught their attention (or what they like best) and why.</li>
	<li>Why do you think this story is important?</li>
	<li>How can we live differently now that we know this story (passage)?</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="up">Read, Tell and Correct</h2>

<ul class="up">
	<li>Read the story again. Have someone tell the story and ask the group to correct if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p>Our heavenly Father is willing to forgive the sins of His children. Our sin does not change the fact that God is our Father. But sin does have consequences and it does affect our fellowship with God. We do not enjoy our Father. 1 John 1:9 assures us, &ldquo;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all wickedness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For further enrichment: Read Transferable Concept #2: <em>How You Can Experience God&rsquo;s Love and Forgiveness </em>and discuss with another group member.</p>

<h2 class="back">Motivation and Encouragement</h2>

<p>John 16 teaches us that the Holy Spirit is actively at work in the hearts of those around us. He is showing them their sin. He is creating a desire to be right with God. He is creating a longing to avoid the fear of death, which is eternal judgment. He is tearing down the objections of their minds and hearts. Our job is to fish for those people through witnessing, finding those whose hearts are ready. Let&rsquo;s encourage each other by reminding each other that the Spirit is already working before we even go.</p>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p>The night before Jesus was crucified, he had dinner with his 12 closest disciples. He told them He was going away but that He was going to send the Counsellor, the Holy Spirit, to be with them forever. He teaches them that through the presence of the Holy Spirit living in them, He himself will be with them. This story uses the image of a vine and its branches to describe what our relationship with Jesus should be like.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Without Jesus, we cannot do anything. We can only have a fruitful life when we depend on and remain in Him. This happens as we submit in obedience to His ways, allowing his life to flow in and through us so that we can bear fruit for the glory of God. In other words, we need to let the Spirit of Christ, the Holy Spirit, direct and empower our lives by faith.&nbsp;</p>

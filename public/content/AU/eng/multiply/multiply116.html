<h2 class="back">Motivation and Encouragement</h2>

<p>One day Jesus sent out His followers to minister to people in the surrounding villages.&nbsp;<br />
When they returned they were so excited about all that God had done through them, &ldquo;Lord, even the demons obey us when we use your name!&rdquo; After Jesus celebrated with them, He gave them this perspective: &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t rejoice because evil spirits obey you; rejoice because your names are registered in heaven.&rdquo; (Luke 10:17-20) Jesus reminds us that our joy is not found in results but that we know Him!&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p>The early church was committed to one another. They were meeting together regularly, and many new people were coming to Christ. After a time of persecution, they prayed for boldness and the Lord helped them speak the gospel boldly. This story about the believers in Jerusalem shows their commitment to one another.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Even from the beginning of the church, the believers cared for one another&rsquo;s needs by giving. We learn from this story that we should give willingly, not under compulsion. This is clearly stated in 2 Corinthians 9:7. Read Acts 11:27-29. The early church also gave to believers in other churches. This shows us that our giving can be used for needs outside of our own church. Read Luke 8:1-3. This story shows us that giving is also used for taking the gospel to other places and spread God&rsquo;s message. In 1 Corinthians 16:2, Paul encourages people to practice giving each week to be used for these purposes.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="back">Motivation and Encouragement</h2>

<p class="back">The first words of Jesus in Mark were telling people to &ldquo;repent.&rdquo; This means to change our whole way of thinking because God&rsquo;s ways are so different from ours. One area is how we view ourselves. We need a new understanding of life with God and what He can do in our lives. The next words of Jesus were &quot;Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.&quot; Every disciple of Jesus is called to live out this twin call to follow Him and fish for men. Our sacrificial commitment to Jesus transforms daily life and all our relationships. Let&rsquo;s encourage each other to continually repent, follow and fish!</p>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p class="up">A couple of weeks before Jesus&rsquo; death, He and His followers were in a town called Jericho. As they left to travel the 24 km up the mountain to Jerusalem, a blind man calls out to Jesus trying to get his attention. This story tells us what happened next.</p>

<h2 class="up">Read</h2>

<div id="bible">

	<li>Everyone tells what caught their attention (or what they like best) and why.</li>
	<li>Why do you think this story is important?</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="up">Read, Tell and Correct</h2>

<ul class="up">
	<li>Read the story again. Have someone tell the story and ask the group to correct if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Jesus has great compassion for people! He asked the blind man an amazing question, &ldquo;What do you want me to do for you?&rdquo; Then He met the man&rsquo;s needs. In John 14:12-13 Jesus said, &ldquo;Whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father. Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do that the Father may be glorified in the Son.&rdquo; As followers of Jesus, we take the initiative to show compassion for people in the power of the Spirit by asking people the same Amazing Question and by meeting their needs in practical ways.</p>

<h2 class="forward">Preparing for Mission</h2>

<p class="forward">It is quite probable that your listener, after hearing about a situation where you needed God&rsquo;s intervention, will tell you about a similar need where prayer is a possible solution. Otherwise, ask them if there&rsquo;s something in their life that they would like to have changed (pain, difficulties, a heavy heart).</p>

<p class="forward">Ask them if you can pray for their need. When you pray, pray to Jesus (Acts 4:12 and Philippians 2:9-11). God is a term used in many religions, but Jesus is our redeemer and the way to the Father in heaven. Make your prayer as easy and as short as possible. If the situation allows, let your friend pray after you.</p>

<p class="forward">If you want to lay on hands, then ask first if it&rsquo;s alright for them and lay your hands on a spot that doesn&rsquo;t hurt or make anyone feel embarrassed. Shoulders are always a good option and God is powerful enough to heal body parts you aren&rsquo;t touching directly.</p>

<p class="forward">Ask immediately afterwards how the person you prayed for is feeling.</p>

<p class="forward">If you have prayed for physical healing and they can&rsquo;t say it in words, use a scale of 0&ndash;10 (&ldquo;Is the pain the same as before praying? On a scale of 0&ndash;10 what is the pain like now?&rdquo;) This may vary between 0 (complete healing) to 10 (no change). It doesn&rsquo;t matter so much what number we get, because a little bit of healing is still significant.</p>

<p class="forward">The goal is to pray with them, trusting the Holy Spirit will do something in their lives to reveal Jesus.</p>

<p class="forward">What if nothing happens? No problem. You can relax completely. Firstly, they will see that it&rsquo;s not dependent on you and it will show that you are authentic, and secondly it gives you an opportunity to pray again some other time. If Jesus heals, then it will be clear who was doing the healing.</p>

<p class="forward">Even if nothing happens, people will still get to experience how you have a personal relationship with God.</p>

<p class="forward">Two things people will always experience when you pray:</p>

<ol>
	<li class="forward">You have a personal relationship with God.</li>
	<li class="forward">They feel Jesus&rsquo; love through your prayer.</li>
</ol>

<p class="forward">Jesus has worked a miracle. Ask them if they would like to get to know Jesus better. If they do, you can organize a meeting at a place where they feel comfortable. This may be at their house, your house, cafe, pub, etc.</p>

<h2 class="forward">Going on the Mission&nbsp;</h2>

<ul>
	<li class="forward">What is God revealing as your next steps this week with him and others?</li>
	<li class="forward">Share this step with the group and ask someone to pray for you as you take this step in the power of the Holy Spirit.</li>
	<li class="forward">Commit everyone&rsquo;s goals to the Lord. Ask the Lord to help us be faithful and use us to start a movement of people living the MyFriends Lifestyle.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

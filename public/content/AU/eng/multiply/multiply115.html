<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Jesus modelled to His followers a way to remember His sacrificial death on the cross. [Take a piece of bread] The bread represents His body that was broken for us. [Show them wine or juice] The drink represents His blood that was shed for us and opened a new way to relate to God. He also commanded them to keep practicing it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="up">In 1 Corinthians 11:23-30, we see that as Paul started new churches, he taught all new believers how to obey Jesus&rsquo; command.&nbsp;</p>

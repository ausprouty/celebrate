<h2 class="back">Motivation and Encouragement</h2>

<p>Since everyone is called to follow Jesus and fish for men, we should realize there are only two kinds of people in the world-- lost and saved. Lost people need to follow Jesus. Saved people need to learn to fish for the lost. When you see the world as two types of people, then your daily interactions get much simpler. If you meet a lost person, witness to them. If you meet a saved person, offer to train them. It can&rsquo;t get much easier than that!&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p>Read Acts 10:1-8. Peter was directed by the Spirit to go to a seaside town called Caesarea where a Roman military leader named Cornelius lived. He was a God- prepared Person of Peace. Peter obeyed and traveled to Caesarea to tell Cornelius about Jesus. Let&rsquo;s see what happens.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Persons of Peace are people of relationship. We can share the gospel with individual people, but we need to also look for opportunities to follow open doors to share with the friends and family of Persons of Peace. Other examples of the gospel spreading through relationships are Lydia and her household (Acts 16:14-15), the Philippian jailer and his household (Acts 16:30-33) and Matthew the tax collector and his friends (Matthew 9:9-10).&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="forward">Preparing for Mission</h2>

<p class="forward">What kind of a social network do your friends have? When they share their experiences within their social network, whole groups of people may get interested in getting to know Jesus (as we read in Acts 10:19-24 and Acts 16:12-15).</p>

<p class="forward">We &ldquo;release&rdquo; our friends by telling them the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li class="forward">Don&rsquo;t keep your experiences with God to yourself. Share them with your social network (friends, family, neighbours).</li>
	<li class="forward">You can pray with your friends, colleagues, family, neighbours, so they may experience God&rsquo;s love as well.</li>
	<li class="forward">Tell them that they can become a friend of God too.</li>
	<li class="forward">Discover God with your friends by going through the 10 Basic Lessons.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="forward">Going on the Mission&nbsp;</h2>

<ul class="forward">
	<li class="forward">What is God revealing as your next steps this week with him and others?</li>
	<li class="forward">Share this step with the group and ask someone to pray for you as you take this step in the power of the Holy Spirit.</li>
	<li class="forward">Commit everyone&rsquo;s goals to the Lord. Ask the Lord to help us be faithful and use us to start a movement of people living the MyFriends Lifestyle.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

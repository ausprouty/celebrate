<h2 class="back">Motivation and Encouragement</h2>

<p class="back">God changes lives and uses them for His glory. One example is the story of a middle eastern man named Adam. He was trained to be a martyr for his religion. But all of that changed one night when he dramatically met Christ. He was so excited about his new relationship to Christ, he began to witness to all of those he knew. Despite being persecuted, he continues to share the gospel and train others. Encourage them by reading 1 Corinthians 1:24-31.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p>Jesus challenged four men to follow Him and learn to fish for men. As Jesus was training his followers to fish for men, he modelled six different situations to them. The last situation was to an unlikely government official who would join the four men and become one of Jesus&rsquo; closest followers.&nbsp;.</p>

</ul>

<h2 class="up">Read, Tell and Correct</h2>

<ul class="up">
	<li>Read the story again. Have someone tell the story and ask the group to correct if necessary.</li>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Read Luke 10:1-11. Jesus sent out his followers to do the same things he had been doing: praying for people, caring for their needs and sharing about the Kingdom. This can be summarized as Prayer, Care, Share. He multiplied himself by training and sending out new workers. The Person of Peace is a God- prepared person who will receive you and your message. Through their relationships, they open new networks of people to the gospel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="up">For further enrichment: Study the following Persons of Peace and discuss with another group member: Luke 19:1-10, Mark 5:14-20, John 4:1-42, Acts 16:13-15&nbsp;</p>

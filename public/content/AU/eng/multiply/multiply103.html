<h2 class="back">Motivation and Encouragement</h2>

<p>One day a woman went to visit her neighbour. As they were talking, she shared the gospel with her neighbour and her neighbour placed her faith in Christ. But then the woman started crying. &ldquo;My husband just died two weeks ago. Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me this sooner?&rdquo; You see, we never know when people&rsquo;s last day will be. That&rsquo;s why we must share the gospel when we have the chance.&nbsp;.</p>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p>When we place our faith in Jesus, God&rsquo;s Spirit begins to live inside of us. He is called the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth and our Helper. His ministry in our lives is so important that we will take time to study our relationship with Him.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="up">Read</h2>

<div id="bible">
<div class="bible">
<p>Read or watch 1 Corinthians 2:14-3:3 two times as everyone listens</p>

<h2 class="up">Discovery Discussion</h2>

<ul class="up">
	<li>Everyone tells what caught their attention (or what they like best) and why.</li>
	<li>Why do you think this story is important?</li>
	<li>How can we live differently now that we know this story (passage)?</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="up">Read, Tell and Correct</h2>

<ul class="up">
	<li>Read the story again. Have someone tell the story and ask the group to correct if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p>Though all Christians have the Spirit living in them, not all Christians are directed and empowered by the Spirit. When we trust in our own efforts or take control of our lives, the Bible calls us carnal and we don&rsquo;t experience an abundant or fruitful life. Read Galatians 5:22-24. We can use 3 circles to help us remember the 3 types of people described in 1 Corinthians (See Satisfied, The Christ-centred Life)</p>

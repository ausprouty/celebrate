<h2 class="back">Praise</h2>

<p class="back">Read Romans 11:33-36 and sing 1-2 songs.</p>

<h2 class="back">Celebrating God&rsquo;s Faithfulness</h2>

<ul class="back">
	<li>How have you experienced God in your life this week?</li>
	<li>How have you experienced God working through your life this week?</li>
	<li>Were you able to tell anyone this week about what God is doing in your life or pray with anyone?</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="back">Caring for each other</h2>

<ul class="back">
	<li>Do you need any help from God in your life?</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="back">Motivation and Encouragement</h2>

<p class="back">In John 3:8, the Spirit of God is described as a wind. We cannot control Him or make Him move; He blows where He wills. We cannot create movements, only the Spirit of God can. But we can position ourselves so that when He does move, we are ready to move with Him. The simple skills you&rsquo;ve been learning help do just that. The good news is this: the Spirit of God is at work everywhere! Let&rsquo;s keep preparing ourselves and praying for the Spirit to move.</p>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p>Paul had been arrested because he was falsely accused by the Jewish leaders of breaking a temple law. During his defence before the Governor, Paul shared the story of how he came to know Christ.</p>

<h2 class="up">Read</h2>

<div id="bible">
<div class="bible">
<p>Read or watch <strong>Acts 22:1-21 </strong> two times as everyone listens</p>
|Bible Text|<br />
<a class="readmore" href="|Reference|">Read More </a></div>
</div>

<h2 class="up">Discovery Discussion</h2>

<ul class="up">
	<li>Everyone tells what caught their attention (or what they like best) and why.</li>
	<li>Why do you think this story is important?</li>
	<li>How can we live differently now that we know this story (passage)?</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="up">Read, Tell and Correct</h2>

<ul class="up">
	<li>Read the story again. Have someone tell the story and ask the group to correct if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Paul&rsquo;s story (testimony) can be summarized in 3 parts:</p>

<ul>
	<li class="up">his life before meeting Christ,</li>
	<li class="up">how he met Christ, and&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="up">his life after meeting Christ.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p class="up">This pattern is still an effective way to tell others what Jesus has done in our lives. Our stories are a powerful witness of the benefits of knowing the Lord.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="forward">Preparing for Mission</h2>

<p class="forward">What others expect me to believe is not relevant in our postmodern culture. However, anything that I have experienced is relevant.</p>

<p class="forward">Sharing your personal experiences is a key way for people to get to know Jesus. It is best to keep your story short (max. 30 seconds). Short stories are easy to listen to and easy to incorporate into everyday conversations.</p>

<p class="forward">Take context into account: Share stories that have something in common with the listener&rsquo;s experiences and which they will find easy to identify with. Telling a father about how God helped you in your relationship to your children will communicate better than if you tell the same story to a teenager who doesn&rsquo;t have kids. An athlete, who&rsquo;s been dogged by injury, will find stories about God healing physically especially relevant.</p>

<p class="forward">Share your feelings: Your friends will find it easier to follow your story if you talk about your feelings.</p>

<p class="forward">For example: &ldquo;I was really scared of an exam. I&rsquo;d often failed and had blackouts during past exams. Last week I spoke with a friend and we prayed to Jesus to calm my heart. As we prayed, I felt such a peace that I went to the exam with a completely different outlook. I don&rsquo;t know what my grade is, but I was able to remember everything and felt really calm. It was amazing!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="forward">Be honest, real and personal: It&rsquo;s not about impressing your listeners. You can be honest about your weaknesses and difficulties. People know that we&rsquo;re not perfect, but we want to tell them that we&rsquo;ve got a great God who is our friend. Your listener will find it easier to be honest, if you&rsquo;re open about your difficulties.</p>

<p class="forward">For example: &ldquo;I was driving the other day and someone cut me off. I got really angry. I took a breath and asked Jesus to help me calm down. Instead of driving aggressively, I calmed down, and was able to let it go.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
	<li class="forward">Grab a partner and think of a story about how Jesus has answered a prayer in everyday life and share it in under 30 seconds.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="forward">Going on the Mission&nbsp;</h2>

<ul>
	<li class="forward">What is God revealing as your next steps this week with him and others?</li>
	<li class="forward">Share this step with the group and ask someone to pray for you as you take this step in the power of the Holy Spirit.</li>
	<li class="forward">Commit everyone&rsquo;s goals to the Lord. Ask the Lord to help us be faithful and use us to start a movement of people living the MyFriends Lifestyle.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

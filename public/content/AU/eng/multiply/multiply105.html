<h2 class="back">Motivation and Encouragement</h2>

<p>As Jesus went through all the towns and villages, he saw the needs of the people and had compassion on them. He said to his disciples, &quot;The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.&quot; God wants all people to know him and his love. He wants to use us and He will also raise up more workers from the harvest we will reap. Let&rsquo;s keep asking God to send more workers to lead people to know Him.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p>Even though Jesus was busy in ministry, he spent a lot of time talking to the Father. As his followers watched him, they too wanted to learn how to talk to the Father. Today we will learn what he told them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="up">Read</h2>

<div id="bible">
<div class="bible">
<p>Read or watch Luke 11:1-13&nbsp;two times as everyone listens</p>

<h2 class="up">Discovery Discussion</h2>

<ul class="up">
	<li>Everyone tells what caught their attention (or what they like best) and why.</li>
	<li>Why do you think this story is important?</li>
	<li>How can we live differently now that we know this story (passage)?</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="up">Read, Tell and Correct</h2>

<ul class="up">
	<li>Read the story again. Have someone tell the story and ask the group to correct if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p>Prayer is simply talking to our heavenly Father. We can use these four points to summarize what Jesus taught:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Praise Him and keep Him the centre;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Request what you need from Him;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Acknowledge your sins;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Yield your life to His will and to His Kingdom.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>We can be confident that He hears us and that His heart is to give us good things.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="forward">Preparing for Mission</h2>

<ul class="forward">
	<li>Spend time praying using the four points in the summary.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="forward">Hearing God&#39;s Voice</h2>

<p class="forward">&ldquo;His sheep follow him because they know his voice.&rdquo; - John 10:4b</p>

<ul>
	<li class="forward">What are some ways that God speaks to us? What have you experienced?</li>
	<li class="forward">Discuss this as a group.</li>
</ul>

<p class="forward">When God speaks it is always from love, with truth, goodness, brings life, releases peace, and gives hope. It is always anchored to the Word of God, and reflective of the character and nature of Jesus. When we speak it should reflect how God speaks.</p>

<ul>
	<li class="forward">Pair up with someone. Read Galatians 5:22-23 and ask the Holy Spirit to highlight a spiritual fruit that He wants to affirm in their life. &nbsp;Share what you have heard from God and thank Him for that fruit in their life.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="forward">Go back to your daisy and ask Jesus who to focus on in daily prayer, practical care, and love over the next week. When a name stands out to you, circle it. You can pray, &ldquo;How do you see them Father? What do you want to say to them or do for them?&rdquo; If you have an idea, scripture, picture, or practical action comes to mind for a someone on your daisy, write that next to their name.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="forward">Going on the Mission</h2>

<ul>
	<li class="forward">What is God revealing as your next steps this week with him and others?</li>
	<li class="forward">Share this step with the group and ask someone to pray for you as you take this step in the power of the Holy Spirit.</li>
	<li class="forward">Commit everyone&rsquo;s goals to the Lord. Ask the Lord to help us be faithful and use us to start a movement of people living the MyFriends Lifestyle.&nbsp;<br />

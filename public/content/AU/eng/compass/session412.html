        Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and

        Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy

        The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they

  <p>
    The Word of God is the written (Bible), but also the living Word (Jesus). It
    is the essence which I discover while reading the Bible, but also when the
    Holy Spirit speaks to me. <br />The Word of God is compared to a seed.
    Similar to a seed, all the essentials are encompassed in the Word of God,
    including the necessary power to grow (Hebrews 4:12:
    <span class="unknown">“</span>For the word of God is alive and active.”).
  </p>
  <p>
    Jesus tells another parable relating to seed: Mark 4:26-29. The man is
    completely clueless how the seed grows exactly. It
    <span class="unknown">“</span>simply happens” after the seed was sown. Many
    Christians try hard to grow spiritually. But the New Testament teaches us
    that the Holy Spirit will provide growth, if we are faithful in our part of
    the equation:
  </p>
  <p>
    Hearing God’s Word – His promises for us or a description of what He’s like
    and how He sees us – (for example from our own lips) and to persevere in
    holding on to it (Luke 8:15).

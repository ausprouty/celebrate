    <span
      >Conflicts are part of life. As lo ng as we are here on earth we can be
      sure that we’ll face a relational conflict because we humans will always
      have different style preferences, views and personalities, and we also
      won‘t always act correctly.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span
      >Normally we hesitate to tackle a conflict or postpone a response because
      we don’t want to place ourselves in an uncomfortable situation. But
      unaddressed conflicts will always increase and have even more negative
      effects on our relationships.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span
      >Jesus’ advice is to take the initiative. Interestingly, Jesus tells us to
      take the initiative not only if we hold something against our friend, but
      also if our friend holds something against us. In both cases Jesus wants
      us to act and not to wait.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span
      >Jesus is not talking about something he hasn’t modeled for us. When Jesus
      noticed a conflict he tackled it as quickly as possible (e.g. Mark
      8:33-34).
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span
      >&nbsp;Jesus tells us not to ignore conflicts. Conflicts can’t be avoided,
      but managed. Here are some examples of people in the Bible who managed
      conflicts in different ways: Acts 6:1-6 and Genesis 13:1-9.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="unknown">Some other Bible verses about conflict resolution:</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Colossians 3:13</li>
    <li>Romans 12:17-21</li>
    <li>James 1:19</li>

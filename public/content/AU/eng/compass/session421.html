        They brought them before the magistrates and said, “These men are Jews,
        and are throwing our city into an uproar
      </span>
      <sup class="versenum">21</sup>
      <span>
        by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice.”

    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">22</sup>The crowd joined in the attack against
      Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten
      with rods.<sup class="versenum">23</sup>After they had been severely
      flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to
      guard them carefully.<sup class="versenum">24</sup>When he received
      these orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the
      stocks.
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">25</sup>About midnight Paul and Silas were
      praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening
      to them.<sup class="versenum">26</sup>Suddenly there was such a
      violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once
      all the prison doors flew open, and everyone’s chains came loose.<sup class="versenum">
        &nbsp;27
      </sup>The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew
      his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners
      had escaped.<sup class="versenum">28</sup>But Paul shouted, “Don’t
      harm yourself! We are all here!”
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">29</sup>The jailer called for lights, rushed
      in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.<sup class="versenum">
        &nbsp;30
      </sup>He then brought them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be
      saved?”
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">31</sup>They replied, “Believe in the Lord
      Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.”<sup class="versenum">
        &nbsp;32
      </sup>Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in
      his house.<sup class="versenum">33</sup>At that hour of the night
      the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all
      his household were baptized.<sup class="versenum">34</sup>The jailer
      brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with
      joy because he had come to believe in God—he and his whole household.

    Elijah was in great despair because he was on the run from King Ahab, who
    reigned northern Israel roughly from 871 – 852 BC. So God sent Elijah to a
    widow in Zarephath, in the region of modern day Lebanon.

    <p>
      <sup>8</sup>Then the word of the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
      came to him:<sup>9</sup>“Go at once to Zarephath in the
      region of Sidon and stay there. I have directed a widow there to supply
      you with food.”<sup>10</sup>So he went to Zarephath. When
      he came to the town gate, a widow was there gathering sticks. He called to
      her and asked, “Would you bring me a little water in a jar so I may have a
      drink?”<sup>11</sup>As she was going to get it, he
      called, “And bring me, please, a piece of bread.”
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup>12</sup>“As surely as the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
      your God lives,” she replied, “I don’t have any bread—only a handful of
      flour in a jar and a little olive oil in a jug. I am gathering a few
      sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son, that we may eat
      it—and die.”
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup>13</sup>Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go
      home and do as you have said. But first make a small loaf of bread for me
      from what you have and bring it to me, and then make something for
      yourself and your son.<sup>14</sup>For this is what the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: ‘The jar of
      flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the
      day the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
      sends rain on the land.’”
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup>15</sup>She went away and did as Elijah had told
      her. So there was food every day for Elijah and for the woman and her
      family.<sup>16</sup>For the jar of flour was not used up
      and the jug of oil did not run dry, in keeping with the word of the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
      spoken by Elijah.

      What can we learn about Godly principles of giving? Also read 2
      Corinthians 9,6-8 and Luke 6,38.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do you have faith that God is your provider and that you won’t be lacking
      anything if you trust him and act according to his plan (Psalms 23,1)? Do
      you doubt this in any way or do you realize acting more out of fear in
      some areas (regarding finances, work, relationships, etc)?
    </li>
    <li>
      What principles do you live by when it comes to giving? What did you learn
      today and what would you like to change? Note down your 2-3 most important
      points and share them in the group.
    </li>
    <li>
      Did you plan an evangelistic event or a project for students that need
      considerable financial resources? Or are there recurring expenses in your
      student movement that you’re part of (e.g. office rent)? Ask Jesus by
      yourself in prayer, how you can contribute to cover these financial needs
      (E.g.: donate yourself, ask in your network, organize a fundraiser, etc).

    Many people feel like they never have enough. But when we read about the
    widow, who was at the stage of using up the last of her resources, with no
    more food to eat, our argument that we first need to have enough for
    ourselves before we can start giving away, loses its validity.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this moment, Elijah gives the woman an interesting promise: If she feeds
    him now, she will never ever run out of flour and oil again. But for the
    promise to become reality, she was first required to bake Elijah a small
    flat bread.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jesus is challenging us to a very similar lifestyle: “Give, and it will be
    given to you” (Luke 6:38). This statement seems inconsistent with the
    principles of the world we live in. Here we learn: If you give something
    away, you’ll have less. But if we are connected to Jesus, we live in new
    dimensions. We’re not on our own anymore, but are connected to the giver of
    all good gifts, who loves to provide for us (James 1:17; 2 Corinthians 9:8;
    Psalms 23:1).
  </p>
  <p>
    The widow experienced a miraculous multiplication of her flour and oil,
    because she trusted Elijah's promises and did as he told her, even though it
    probably didn’t appear reasonable to her at first. Likewise, we will
    experience God’s provision, if we are ready to give what God challenges us
    to give.

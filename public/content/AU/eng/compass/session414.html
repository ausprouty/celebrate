  <p>Practical steps how you can grow through forgiveness:</p>
  <p>
    ▶ <strong>Identify:</strong>&nbsp;Take time to note on a piece of paper the
    names of a few people who have hurt you. Also list what kind of
    reaction/emotions (anger, fear, retreat, and so on) you had as a result of
    their actions. Now you can read these notes to God in a prayer. You can pray
    like this: “Heavenly father, I confess now what ___________ did to me.”
    (call out the name and the injury). It is important that we first identify
    what happened to us before we move on to the next step.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    ▶<strong>Forgive:</strong> Then you can forgive this person. You can pray
    like this: “Heavenly father, I forgive ___________ (enter name). I give
    him/her into Your hand. I bless him/her and decide to hold no grudge against
    him/her.”
  </p>
  <p>
    ▶<strong>&nbsp;Receive:</strong> Let yourself be <em>filled</em> anew with
    God’s love: Pray according to Ephesians 3:17-19 – in groups of two or three
    – that God will fill you anew with His love and the Holy Spirit.

  <p>
    Forgive people who sinned against you. This step is important, because we
    are not made to deal with guilt and sin. It does not matter whether it is
    our own sin, or situations where people sinned against us.<br />When we
    forgive, it doesn’t mean we approve of what has been done and say that it
    was <span class="unknown">“OK</span>”. Rather, we hand over the right for
    redemption to Jesus.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sin always needs to be brought to the cross! Unforgiveness will always bind
    us to a person. Only forgiveness cuts that bond and will make you truly
    free! Forgiveness opens the gates of heaven over you so that you can be
    blessed. It disrupts destructive influences and frees you to live a life in
    the power and authority of the Lord. Also, don’t forget that forgiveness
    starts in the will, not emotions. So you don’t have to
    <span class="unknown">“</span>feel like” you want to forgive. Just forgive.
    Emotions often follow later.

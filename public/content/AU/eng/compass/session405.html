Pause for a second and ask Jesus in a silent prayer. Write down the thoughts/impressions that come into your mind (everyone by themselves).

Here are some tips:</li></ol><ol><ol><li>&nbsp;Submit your soul - your will, emotions, intellect - to the Spirit of God.</li><li>It could be that you don‘t receive an answer to a question, because God wants you to take a step of faith first.

I submit my soul and hence my will, my emotions, and my intellect to Your authority. I want to reach out to You and do only what You tell me to do. Make the eyes and ears of my heart sensitive to You. Teach me to discern Your speaking and my thoughts, so that I am lead by the Holy Spirit and not by my own wishful thinking or my surroundings.”</p><div class="lesson-section"><img class="lesson-icon" src = "/images/compass/background.png"/><div class="lesson-section-words">SCRIPTURE COMMENTS</div> </div><p><strong>Basic principles:</strong></p><ul><li>God’s word reveals His specific will and His general will (see Matthew 28:18-20).</li><li><span>“</span>Your kingdom come” (Luke 11:2) should be our first and foremost thought in decision making.</li><li>In many specific situations, we do not find a direct answer in the Bible, so it is important to develop sensitivity for God’s will over time. Our recognition of His will grows alongside our familiarity with God (Romans 12:2).</li></ul><p>Jesus is our role model in everything. He did only what He saw the Father do (John 5:19). We are called to live the same way. Therefore it is vital that we learn to hear and discern God’s voice.</p><p><strong>Life Story:</strong></p><p>Gladys Aylward (born on February 24, 1902, in London) came to Yangcheng in the Chinese province of Shanxi in 1932 to tell people about Jesus.</p><p>During the Chinese-Japanese war she took in many orphans. In 1940, the situation worsened. After Japanese aircraft bombed Yangcheng, she asked God what they could do. <span>“</span>She is waiting in her halfway destroyed chamber with a profound faith for an order from her King. Her soul is searching out and hearkening, just as Samuel did when he said: “Speak, for your servant is listening” (1 Samuel 3:10). And the Lord speaks, and her soul receives faith in His order: “Flee...!” There was no trace of doubt left. The Lord spoke, therefore she has to leave.”</p><p>(Translated from: Mijnders-van Woerden, M.A.: Gladys Aylward – Die Frau mit dem Buch, p.182).</p><p>After hearning God’s word, she and almost a hundred chidren fled by foot over the mountains to Xi’an. On her way they continuously encountered situations, where they needed to ask God for directions and heard from Him what they should do. In doing so, they experienced His guidance and protection.</p><br /><br />

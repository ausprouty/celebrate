      <sup>20</sup>
      <span>
        Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came
        up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak.

      What can we learn about faith from the woman and the two blind men?&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      God reacts to your faith. For what situation or area in your life do you
      need faith?
    </li>
    <li>
      To have faith also means to act. Where does the Holy Spirit encou&shy;rage
      you to take steps of faith?
    </li>
    <li>Note this down and then share in groups of two or three.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    ▶&nbsp;You can pray the following prayer: “Thank you, dear Heavenly Father,
    that You have given me Your Holy Spirit, who teaches me to trust and have
    faith. Forgive me, where I trusted my experiences more than Your Word and
    thus have acted in unbelief. Train me so I can grow in faith. I want to
    learn to see things from Your perspective in every situation, to focus on
    what happens in the spiritual realm and not the visible realm. Help me to
    understand Your Word and Your perspective more and more.”

    <div class="lesson-section-words">SCRIPTURE COMMENTS</div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Faith means that we accept and proclaim what God thinks about a situation
    and what is possible for him. Because to have faith means to know that the
    visible realm – our limitations, experiences, sorrows – are not the only
    reality. The spiritual realm is the place where the script for your life is
    written. The visible realm is only what happens on the screen. Abraham
    showed us what faith is. He had to wait a really long time before he could
    have a son. All aspects of Abraham’s and Sarah’s lives had long been
    indicating that they would not be able get a son. But Abraham persisted and
    put his trust in God and His promise.
  </p>
  <p>
    To us, God’s Word, the written and living Word (Jesus), is the crucial tool
    for us to grow in faith. Because it transmits the real truth about...
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      …what God is like – He for whom everything is possible, who fights for us,
      who hears the cries of our hearts (Psalm 34:7), our provider, prince of
      peace, doctor, shelter, wisdom, beginning and the end, and so on.
    </li>
    <li>
      …and what he did for us – we are accepted, loved, his children, envoys, he
      made us kings and priests, and so on.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Steps to faith:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>God’s Word: Know who God is and what He did for us.</li>
    <li>
      Prayer: Proclaim this over you or a situation you’re in (“Heavenly Father,
      you are…” and “in your eyes, I am…”).
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Remember. If we hear God’s word (even from our own lips) and hold on to it
    perseveringly, it will bring fruit. It will release faith for God’s plans in
    our lives (Romans 10:14; Luke 8:15).

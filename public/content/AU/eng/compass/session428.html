    <p class="reference">1 Samuel 1:1-26</p>
    <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;1</sup>There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a
    Zuphite from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of
    Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.<sup class="versenum">
      &nbsp;2
    </sup>He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah.
    Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;3</sup>Year after year this man went up from
      his town to worship and sacrifice to the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
      Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were
      priests of the
      <span class="small-caps">
        Lord
      </span>.<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;4</sup>Whenever the day came for
      Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife
      Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.<sup class="versenum">
        &nbsp;5
      </sup>But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
      had closed her womb.<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;6</sup>Because the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
      had closed Hannah’s womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to
      irritate her.<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;7</sup>This went on year after
      year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, her rival provoked her till she wept
      and would not eat.<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;8</sup>Her husband Elkanah
      would say to her, “Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don’t you eat? Why are
      you downhearted? Don’t I mean more to you than ten sons?”
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;9</sup>Once when they had finished eating and
      drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his
      chair by the doorpost of the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s house.<sup class="versenum">
        &nbsp;10
      </sup>In her deep anguish Hannah prayed to the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, weeping bitterly.<sup class="versenum">
        &nbsp;11
      </sup>And she made a vow, saying, “<span
        class="small-caps"
        style="font-variant: small-caps;"
      >
        Lord
      </span>
      Almighty, if you will only look on your servant’s misery and remember me,
      and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to
      the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
      for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head.”
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;12</sup>As she kept on praying to the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, Eli observed her mouth.<sup class="versenum">
        &nbsp;13
      </sup>Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her
      voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk<sup class="versenum">
        &nbsp;14
      </sup>and said to her, “How long are you going to stay drunk? Put away
      your wine.”
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;15</sup>“Not so, my Lord,” Hannah replied, “I
      am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer;
      I was pouring out my soul to the
      <span class="small-caps">
        Lord
      </span>.<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;16</sup>Do not take your servant for a
      wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief.”
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;17</sup>Eli answered, “Go in peace, and may
      the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him.”
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;18</sup>She said, “May your servant find favor
      in your eyes.” Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was
      no longer downcast.
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;19</sup>Early the next morning they arose and
      worshiped before the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
      and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah made love to his wife
      Hannah, and the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
      remembered her.<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;20</sup>So in the course of
      time Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel,
      saying, “Because I asked the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
      for him.”
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;21</sup>When her husband Elkanah went up with
      all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
      and to fulfill his vow,<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;22</sup>Hannah did not
      go. She said to her husband, “After the boy is weaned, I will take him and
      present him before the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and he will live there always.”
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;23</sup>“Do what seems best to you,” her
      husband Elkanah told her. “Stay here until you have weaned him; only may
      the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
      make good his word.” So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until
      she had weaned him.
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;24</sup>After he was weaned, she took the boy
      with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of
      flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
      at Shiloh.<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;25</sup>When the bull had been
      sacrificed, they brought the boy to Eli,<sup class="versenum">
        &nbsp;26
      </sup>and she said to him, “Pardon me, my Lord. As surely as you live, I
      am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.

  <p>What you can pray to God for together (choose two topics from below):</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      For things that discomfort you: <span class="unknown">“</span>Don‘t worry
      about anything. Instead, tell God about everything. Ask and pray. Give
      thanks to Him. Then God’s peace will watch over your hearts and your minds
      because you belong to Christ Jesus. God’s peace can never be completely
      understood” (Philippians 4:6-7).
    </li>
    <li>
      For more Christian students who want to lead an evangelistic lifestyle and
      are ready to invest themselves in God’s Kingdom on your campus: Then He
      said to His disciples, <span class="unknown">“</span>The harvest is
      plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore,
      to send out workers into His harvest field” (Matthew 9:37-38).
    </li>
    <li>
      For open doors in your everyday life that you can witness to nonbelievers
      what you experience with Jesus: ”Pray for us, too. Pray that God will open
      a door for our message. Then we can preach the mystery of Christ ...”
      (Colossians 4:3).
    </li>
    <li>
      For someone (for example, in your group) who needs healing:
      <span class="unknown">“</span>Are any of you sick? Then send for the
      elders of the church to pray over you. Ask them to anoint you with oil in
      the name of the Lord. The prayer offered by those who have faith will make
      you well. The Lord will heal you. If you have sinned, you will be
      forgiven” (James 5:14-15).

  <p>
    True intercession is also based on the desire to unify with God and not just
    on an attempt to make Him do something. Intercession is born when you have
    the same attitude that John had during the Last Supper – put our heads on
    his chest, where we can feel his heartbeat. Then&nbsp;our heart will start
    to beat in synchrony to His and what moves His heart will deeply move our
    hearts, too. That is what it truly means to pray in the name of the Father.
    To pray <span class="unknown">“</span>in the name of Jesus Christ” does not
    mean to simply say <span class="unknown">“</span>Jesus”, but to be in unity
    with Him and from there pray with His authority.

    <p class="reference">Luke 15:11-32</p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup>11</sup>
      <span class="unknown">
        Jesus continued: “There was a man who had two sons.
      </span>
      <sup>12</sup>
      <span>
        The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the
        estate.’ So he divided his property between them.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup>13</sup>“Not long after that, the younger son got
      together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered
      his wealth in wild living.<sup>14</sup>After he had spent
      everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began
      to be in need.<sup>15</sup>So he went and hired himself
      out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.<sup>
        16
      </sup>He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were
      eating, but no one gave him anything.
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup>17</sup>“When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How
      many of my father’s hired servants have food to spare, and here I am
      starving to death!<sup>18</sup>I will set out and go back
      to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and
      against you.<sup>19</sup>I am no longer worthy to be
      called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.’<sup>
        20
      </sup>So he got up and went to his father.
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      “But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled
      with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and
      kissed him.
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup>21</sup>“The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned
      against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your
      son.’
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup>22</sup>“But the father said to his servants,
      ‘Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger
      and sandals on his feet.<sup>23</sup>Bring the fattened
      calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate.<sup>
        24
      </sup>For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is
      found.’ So they began to celebrate.
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup>25</sup>“Meanwhile, the older son was in the field.
      When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.<sup>
        26
      </sup>So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on.<sup>
        27
      </sup>‘Your brother has come,’ he replied, ‘and your father has killed the
      fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.’
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup>28</sup>“The older brother became angry and refused
      to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him.<sup>
        29
      </sup>But he answered his father, ‘Look! All these years I’ve been slaving
      for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a
      young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.<sup>
        30
      </sup>But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with
      prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!’
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup>31</sup>“‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are always
      with me, and everything I have is yours.<sup>32</sup>But
      we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead
      and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’”

    Jesus told this parable to unveil something about the heart of our Heavenly
    Father:
  </p>
  <p>
    The younger son was convinced that he was no longer worthy to be considered
    a son by his father. From the son’s perspective, his father had every right
    to say to him: “Yes, your situation is your own fault. Now learn to serve
    and work first”.
  </p>
  <p>
    The older son, in contrast to his brother, never did anything wrong. But he
    also saw himself as a servant of his father. He was silently waiting for a
    sign of recognition for doing his work obediently. This is the “normal”
    worldly perspective. We are quick to think: If you fail, you need to redeem
    yourself. Whether consciously or subconsciously, we often think that to
    receive God’s favour, to be accepted and loved by Him, we need to do
    something.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the father corrected both his sons in their thinking. Jesus wants to
    show us that the Heavenly Kingdom has different principles! Unexpectedly,
    the father said: “Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring
    on his finger and sandals on his feet”. His youngest son probably stank
    severely and was not wearing the nicest of clothes and his father did not
    want him to feel ashamed walking into the house like that.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fatherly heart of God is just the same: He does not want us to be
    exposed in our shame. He goes even further: We are unconditionally loved,
    accepted, chosen. As His sons and daughters, we have permanent access to His
    heavenly treasures: “everything I have is yours” (<a
      href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+15%3A31&amp;version=NIV"
      target="_blank"
    >
      Luke 15:31
    </a>;<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1%3A3&amp;version=NIV">
      Ephesians 1:3
    </a>), be that wisdom, love, strength, forgiveness, healing, joy, comfort,
    hope, faith or courage. Remember another heavenly principle: If we ask, God
    will give us good gifts!&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A7-11&amp;version=NIV">
      Matthew 7:7-11
    </a>)
  </p>
  <p>
    God even gives us the spiritual authority of Jesus in the moment we accept
    Him as his Lord and Saviour. The symbol for that is the ring. This is an
    important principle in the Heavenly Kingdom: If you know deeply in your
    heart that you are a son/daughter of God, you will be at peace. From this,
    God’s life, love and strength will start to flow. But if you are insecure
    about God’s love for you, then confusion, doubt, fear, frustration and
    sorrows will find their way into your life. Do you see yourself as a
    son/daughter of God or as a servant?

        The Philistines assembled to fight Israel, with three thousand chariots,
        six thousand charioteers, and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the

        When the Israelites saw that their situation was critical and that their

    God puts our faith to the test to let us become more like Jesus Christ.
    These <span class="unknown">“</span>tests” happen every once in a while.
    Tests, or temptations are always an opportunity for us to react in a way
    opposite to the provoked reaction and act the way God intended us to: faith
    instead of distrust or skepticism, obedience instead of disobedience,
    forgiveness instead of pride or bitterness, waiting for God instead of
    acting prematurely. Much like problems, tests are a way how God can shape
    our character and ripen the fruits of the Holy Spirit in our lives.

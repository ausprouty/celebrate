      <span>
        On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this
        command: “Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father
        promised, which you have heard me speak about.

        with the Holy Spirit.”

    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup>6</sup>Then they gathered around him and asked him,
      “Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?”
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup>7</sup>He said to them: “It is not for you to know
      the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority.<sup>
        8
      </sup>But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and
      you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and
      to the ends of the earth.”

        <sup>1</sup>As he went along, he saw a man blind from
        birth.
      </span>
      <sup>2</sup>
      <span>
        His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents,
        that he was born blind?”
      </span>

      <sup>3</sup>“Neither this man nor his parents sinned,”
      said Jesus, “but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed
      in him.<sup>4</sup>As long as it is day, we must do the
      works of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work.<sup>

      </sup>While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”

      <sup>6</sup>After saying this, he spit on the ground,
      made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man’s eyes.<sup>

      </sup>“Go,” he told him, “wash in the Pool of Siloam” (this word means
      “Sent”). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing.

      <sup>8</sup>His neighbors and those who had formerly seen
      him begging asked, “Isn’t this the same man who used to sit and beg?”<sup>

    <p class="bible">Others said, “No, he only looks like him.”</p>

      <sup>10</sup>“How then were your eyes opened?” they

    <p class="bible">
      <sup>11</sup>He replied, “The man they call Jesus made
      some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I
      went and washed, and then I could see.”

      had made the mud and opened the man’s eyes was a Sabbath.<sup>

      sight. “He put mud on my eyes,” the man replied, “and I washed, and now I

    </li>
  </ol>

      <li>the before;</li>

    ▶&nbsp;Share with a partner one experience according to this structure. It
    should be an experience that is suitable for a nonbeliever. Pay

  </p>
  <p>
    ▶&nbsp;Pray in groups of two or three for your the people on your prayer
    list (see unit “The Call”) and for opportunities within the next few days to
    share an experience with Jesus with them. Pray that the Holy Spirit opens
    their hearts.

  <p>
    When we share our faith with others, we can simply talk about what we
    experienced – or are experiencing – with Jesus. Share everyday stories.
    Because these are the things others find interesting, exciting and
    relatable. People who don’t know Jesus think that He is someone who makes up
    rules and asks for strict obedience. But obedience is not the starting
    point; rather, it is God’s abundant, unconditional love and that He wants to
    live with us as friends do. As true witnesses, we’re only responsible to be
    filled by the Holy Spirit, to see our friends trough God’s eyes, and to talk
    in accordance with Him when God provides us with an opportunity. However, we
    are not responsible for how the listeners react. It is not our job to
    convince people or to impress them! That‘s the Holy Spirit‘s job.

      you pray for them or help them practically?

      There are different types of good fruit: read e.g. Romans 1:13, Hebrews
      13:15 and Galatians 5:22-23. Which fruit can you already see in your life?
    </li>
    <li>
      Is there something in your life that feels fruitless, i.e. you invest time
      and energy, but you fail to see any results?
    </li>
    <li>
      What are the requirements for good fruit to grow? Which clues can we
      gather from the two passages?
    </li>
    <li>Do you meet those requirements?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    ▶ Is there something you should stop doing so you can be connected to Jesus
    again? Is there an area in your life where you sense that you’re
    disconnected from Jesus? If yes, confess this in a prayer (everyone for
    themselves).
  </p>
  <p>
    ▶ Is there something you should allow God to do in your life? Some&shy;
    thing you know God has in store for you, but you’re beating around the bush
    whenever it comes up? Pray in groups of 2-3. Invite Jesus to lead your whole
    life and shape your future and ask him to fill you fully with his Holy
    Spirit, so that you can carry lots of fruit. You can find practical steps
    for that in the unit <span class="unknown">&nbsp;“</span>Filled“.

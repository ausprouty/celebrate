    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">1</sup>Now Joseph had been taken down to
      Egypt. Potiphar, an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh’s officials, the
      captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him
      there.
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">2</sup>The
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
      was with Joseph so that he prospered, and he lived in the house of his
      Egyptian master.<sup class="versenum">3</sup>When his master saw
      that the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
      was with him and that the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
      gave him success in everything he did,<sup class="versenum">
        &nbsp;4
      </sup>Joseph found favor in his eyes and became his attendant. Potiphar
      put him in charge of his household, and he entrusted to his care
      everything he owned.<sup class="versenum">5</sup>From the time he
      put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
      blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph. The blessing of
      the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
      was on everything Potiphar had, both in the house and in the field.<sup class="versenum">
        &nbsp;6
      </sup>So Potiphar left everything he had in Joseph’s care; with Joseph in
      charge, he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate.
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      Now Joseph was well-built and handsome,<sup class="versenum">7</sup>and
      after a while his master’s wife took notice of Joseph and said, “Come to
      bed with me!”
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">8</sup>But he refused. “With me in charge,” he
      told her, “my master does not concern himself with anything in the house;
      everything he owns he has entrusted to my care.<sup class="versenum">
        &nbsp;9
      </sup>No one is greater in this house than I am. My master has withheld
      nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do
      such a wicked thing and sin against God?”<sup class="versenum">
        &nbsp;10
      </sup>And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to
      bed with her or even be with her.
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">11</sup>One day he went into the house to
      attend to his duties, and none of the household servants was inside.<sup class="versenum">
        &nbsp;12
      </sup>She caught him by his cloak and said, “Come to bed with me!” But he
      left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house.
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">13</sup>When she saw that he had left his
      cloak in her hand and had run out of the house,<sup class="versenum">
        &nbsp;14
      </sup>she called her household servants. “Look,” she said to them, “this
      Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us! He came in here to
      sleep with me, but I screamed.<sup class="versenum">15</sup>When he
      heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the
      house.”
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">16</sup>She kept his cloak beside her until
      his master came home.<sup class="versenum">17</sup>Then she told him
      this story: “That Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of
      me.<sup class="versenum">18</sup>But as soon as I screamed for help,
      he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.”
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">19</sup>When his master heard the story his
      wife told him, saying, “This is how your slave treated me,” he burned with
      anger.<sup class="versenum">20</sup>Joseph’s master took him and put
      him in prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined.
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      But while Joseph was there in the prison,<sup class="versenum">
        &nbsp;21
      </sup>the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
      was with him; he showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of
      the prison warden.<sup class="versenum">22</sup>So the warden put
      Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made
      responsible for all that was done there.<sup class="versenum">
        &nbsp;23
      </sup>The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph’s care,
      because the
      <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
      was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did.

      What difficult situations in your life have provided you with the biggest
      boost in growth?&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      Are you facing a problem you have to overcome? What quality do you think
      God wants to develop in you?&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      In difficult situations, when you are under a lot of pressure, it is more
      important than ever that you hold on to God’s truth – what God is truly
      like and what He is capable of doing – even though you are currently not
      experiencing it and can’t see it with your physical eyes yet. Read John
      8:31-32. What are the requirements to be freed/delivered?
    </li>
    <li>
      Read Matthew 6:33. Are there any practical steps God asks you to do in
      order for you to have His Kingdom as your first priority? For example, do
      you need to change your priorities? This is even more crucial if you are
      facing troubles.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      Read the scripture comments. Note on a piece of paper what you want to put
      in action in the following week. If you should forgive someone, then do it
      according to the unit <span class="unknown">“</span>Growth through
      forgiveness” (everyone on their own).
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    ▶&nbsp;Tell each other what you want to put into action in the following
    days.
  </p>
  <p>
    ▶&nbsp;To finish, pray in pairs and express your trust in God with what you
    have read and what you want to hold on to.

  <p>
    God uses adversity, problems, pressure, stress and difficulties to form your
    personality. Be aware that suffering and persecution are a symptom of the
    battle we fight in the spiritual realm (Ephesians 6:10-12). We cannot choose
    what happens to us, but we can choose how we react to it. If we choose to
    react as Jesus did – with faith, trust,&nbsp;resilience, forgiveness and
    devotion to God – then we will experience how God uses the situation to make
    us more like Jesus, rather than making us bitter. It is your decision
    whether a situation will become a stumbling block or a stepping stone on
    your way to spiritual maturity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Joseph didn’t trivialise those years of adversity and neither should we. But
    he decided to react to hardship and trial according to God’s heart. Through
    that, he learned to trust God’s promises, to serve people, to stay sexually
    pure, to forgive and to wait for God, who then continuously put him in
    positions of responsibility and power. So he could say retrospectively, that
    all things truly work together for our good (Genesis 50:50; Romans 8:28).
    What could help you to keep the right perspective, if you‘re facing
    adversity?
  </p>
  <p>
    Forgive people who are guilty of, or at least complicit in causing your
    problems. If you feel like you should forgive someone, you can find tips in
    the specific questions and scripture comments of the unit
    <span class="unknown">“</span>Growth through forgiveness”.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keep a spiritual journal, asking yourself the question:
    <span class="unknown">“</span>What did I learn from God today?” Note down
    what God tells you and hold on to it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keep a spiritual journal with the question:
    <span class="unknown">“</span>What did I learn from God today?” Especially
    in difficult situations and when you’re under pressure, it is important that
    you hold on to God’s truth and proclaim them so you can hear them, i.e. say
    out loud what God truly is like and what He’s capable of doing, even when
    you don’t experience it and can’t see it with your physical eyes at the
    moment (Ephesians 6:16). Read John 8:31-32. What are the requirements to be
    set free?
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember: what you are going through will eventually pass. God orchestrates
    seasons and times and lets them finish according to His Will. And even if it
    is something you have to endure all your life, it stands in no comparison to
    eternity. God will reward you eternally if you stick to His truth and trust
    Him (2 Corinthians 4:17). Ask God to give you His perspective from eternity
    on your situation. <br />Surround yourself with good friends and pray with
    them. Even Jesus needed friends: Matthew 26:38.

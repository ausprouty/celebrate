      <sup>16</sup>
      <span>
        While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to
        see that the city was full of idols.
      </span>
      <sup class="versenum">17</sup>
      <span>
        So he reasoned in the synagogue with both Jews and God-fearing Greeks,
        as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be
        there.
      </span>
      <sup class="versenum">18</sup>
      <span>
        A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to debate with him.
        Some of them asked, “What is this babbler trying to say?” Others
        remarked, “He seems to be advocating foreign gods.” They said this
        because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the
        resurrection.
      </span>
      <sup class="versenum">19</sup>
      <span>
        Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where
        they said to him, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are
        presenting?
      </span>
      <sup class="versenum">20</sup>
      <span>
        You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we would like to
        know what they mean.”
      </span>
      <sup class="versenum">21</sup>
      <span>
        (All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time
        doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.)
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">22</sup>Paul then stood up in the meeting of
      the Areopagus and said: “People of Athens! I see that in every way you are
      very religious.<sup class="versenum">23</sup>For as I walked around
      and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar
      with this inscription:
     <span class="small-caps">
        to an unknown god.
      </span>
      So you are ignorant of the very thing you worship—and this is what I am
      going to proclaim to you.
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">24</sup>“The God who made the world and
      everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in
      temples built by human hands.<sup class="versenum">25</sup>And he is
      not served by human hands, as if he needed anything. Rather, he himself
      gives everyone life and breath and everything else.<sup class="versenum">
        &nbsp;26
      </sup>From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the
      whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the
      boundaries of their lands.<sup class="versenum">27</sup>God did this
      so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him,
      though he is not far from any one of us.<sup class="versenum">
        &nbsp;28
      </sup>‘For in him we live and move and have our being.’ As some of your
      own poets have said, ‘We are his offspring.’
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">29</sup>“Therefore since we are God’s
      offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or
      silver or stone—an image made by human design and skill.<sup class="versenum">
        &nbsp;30
      </sup>In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all
      people everywhere to repent.<sup class="versenum">31</sup>For he has
      set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has
      appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the
      dead.”
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">32</sup>When they heard about the resurrection
      of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, “We want to hear you
      again on this subject.”<sup class="versenum">33</sup>At that, Paul
      left the Council.<sup class="versenum">34</sup>Some of the people
      became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member
      of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others.

    Verses 32-34 describe three reactions from listeners that we will also
    encounter when we speak about faith. Knowing this helps us to be prepared
    for it.
  </p>
  <ol start="10">
    <li>What are the three reactions?</li>
    <li>
      Who reacted harshly to you because you addressed them with faith topics?
      Note down their names on a separate sheet of paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    How can we deal with negative reactions, particularly with rejection?&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    ▶ Identify the lie behind your fear: When we‘ve experienced rejection and
    remember this as a painful experience, harmful thoughts quickly start to
    creep in. E.g.: “In future, I will protect myself by simply never telling
    anyone anymore about my faith ever again”. With such thoughts, fear is
    creeping into our lives. God designed us to build a deep relationship with
    him and trust him. But fear can hinder us to do so. Fear can start to dig
    its roots in our thoughts. If this is the case, it will always pull us down.
    As a result, fear hinders us to discover treasures God has in store for us
    because it blocks God‘s power, wisdom, love and joy in our lives. How do we
    win against fear? Actually, behind every fear, there usually is a lie. The
    problem are not foreseeable problems or conflicts. The problem is a lie
    about God that we believe. It generally is a lie about God‘s ability to
    protect us, to provide for us and to equip us for any given situation. Did
    you start to believe something false about God‘s abilities in your life as a
    result of an experienced rejection?
  </p>
  <p>
    ▶ Forgive: In order for us to be free from fear and courageously take steps
    forward, it is important that we forgive the person responsible for the said
    experience. Take your time for personal prayer to forgive those you think
    you should forgive (there are some practical steps to help you in unit
    „Growth Through Forgiveness“). Everyone for themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    ▶ Confess: If there is a lie about God‘s character you‘ve believed in so
    far, confess it to God and additionally also your own sinful reactions<br />
    (e.g withdrawal, anger, distrust in Jesus). Everyone for themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    ▶ Replace: Replace the lie by the truth of God. The truth is what God‘s Word
    says about himself and about us. What scripture does the Holy Spirit recall
    in you? What does it say to you? Proclaim this over your situation.
  </p>
  <p>
    ▶ Receive: Pray in groups of 2-3: Submit to the authority and leadership of
    the Holy Spirit and pray that he fills you with love, faith, joy, courage
    and wisdom.

  <p>
    We should not be taken by surprise or feel attacked when people reject the
    gospel.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bill Bright, the founder of Campus Crusade for Christ once said:
    <span class="unknown">“</span>We take initiative in sharing Christ in the
    power of the Holy Spirit and leave the results to God”.<br />If we feel
    rejected by people because of our faith, it is really Jesus that people are
    rejecting. This perspective should help us to better deal with difficult
    reactions and not to feel offended or even attacked (compare Acts 9:1-5).
  </p>
  <p>
    We need to remind ourselves constantly that we are obstructing the kingdom
    of darkness when we speak about faith. Hence negative reactions and
    opposition are not just a human, worldly component, but are really effects
    of a battle that is fought in the spiritual realm (Ephesians 6:12). If we
    experience opposition, it is something completely normal! But it also means
    that we need to learn how to fight. Forgive&shy;ness is one of the most
    powerful weapons in the Kingdom of God against the arrows that are shot at
    us, intended to hurt us or bring us from our path.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jesus tells us not to ignore conflicts. Conflicts can’t be avoided, but
    managed. Here are some examples of people in the Bible who managed conflicts
    in different ways: Acts 6:1-6 und Genesis 13:1-9.
  </p>
  <p>Some other Bible verses about conflict resolution:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>James 1:19</li>
    <li>James 3:17</li>
    <li>Colossians 3:13</li>
    <li>Romans 12:17-21</li>
  </ul>

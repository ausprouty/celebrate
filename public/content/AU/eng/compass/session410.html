      Are you ready to submit fully to the guidance of the Holy Spirit and to be
      empowered by him? To do so, the concept of spiritual bre-athing can help
      you (see also unit: <span class="unknown">“</span>Filled“):

  </ol>
  <p>
    ▶ Exhale: Confess to God, where you were living and thinking in di-saccord
    to his will. Commit to him fully and anew.
  </p>
  <p>▶ Inhale: Ask Got to fill and empower you anew with the Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p>
    ▶ Pray that he fills you anew with God’s love for your student friends. Pray
    for wisdom and courage, that you can share an experience with God with
    someone that does not know Jesus personally yet. Pray that you can pray for
    them, so they can experience God themselves.

  <p>
    Without the Holy Spirit, we cannot be true witnesses of Jesus, because it is
    the Holy Spirit who empowers and authorizes us. It is Him
    that&nbsp;proclaims to the spiritual realm that we are acting on behalf of
    King&nbsp;Jesus. In this world, Jesus was fully God and fully human. Jesus
    submitted himself completely to the Holy Spirit and did nothing out of
    his&nbsp;own (human) will. In doing so, he is our role model and shows us
    how&nbsp;we should live our lives.

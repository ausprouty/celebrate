<p>God loves people! The Bible tells us God’s desire is that all people are saved and come to understand the truth (1 Timothy 2:4). The gospel is not only for you but for all your friends and family. God loves them and will use you to pass on what you are learning about Jesus so that they can follow Jesus also. As we journey together, it will be exciting to see what God will do in the lives of those around us.

<h2 class = "up">Context </h2>
<p>Jesus was teaching that he is the good shepherd who lays down his life for his sheep (v 11). He also said, “I know my sheep and my sheep know me,” and “I have come that they may have life and have it to the full.” However, many of the Jews don’t believe him, and doubt His claims. This is where our story begins.

<p class = "up"></p>On the cross Jesus, the good shepherd, laid down his life as a sacrifice for your sins. As one of his sheep, he wants you to know that you have eternal life and you will never perish. You are safe in his hands and no one, including Satan himself, can snatch you away.

	<p>The most important thing will be how we apply what we learn, and so we want to help each other find ways to do that. Some questions to help us do that:</p>
	<div class="note-forward">
		<ol start = "13" class="nodot">
			<li>How could this or does this change how you will live? With God, self and others?</li>
			<li>What is one thing you would like to apply to your life from this week's discussion? What will you do to make that change?</li>
			<li>With whom will you share what you learned this week? What will you share?</li>
		</ol>

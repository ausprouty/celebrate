Then ask him to fill you with his love and peace (again).</p><p>▶&nbsp;Pray for one another that you can have a fresh encounter with the heavenly Father (see also the scripture comments).</p><div class="lesson-section"><img class="lesson-icon" src = "/images/compass/background.png"/><div class="lesson-section-words">SCRIPTURE COMMENTS</div> </div><p>In life, there are disappointments. A first romance that broke, the &shy;grade in my university paper that I put so much time and effort in. When we have many great and emotional encounters with God, we’re excited about him. When things go a bit differently from expected, God seemingly isn’t doing anything about our situation and/or we don’t understand God, it can easily diminish our trust. In particular our trust in His almightiness and His goodness. Inevitably, we start to feel disappointed with God. To be disappointed with God does not necessarily mean that we’re sinning, if we learn to walk God’s way in these situations, regardless of our emotional state.&nbsp;</p><p>The first thing that Jesus did after this disappointing situation was to deliberately seek God (see Matthew 14:13 and Psalms 23:5). When we don’t understand God, our instinct reaction is to retreat from Him rather than to seek Him. Jesus was fully human, also in this situation. Therefore, He presumably also didn’t fully understand why it would come to such an end. But He deliberately sought God.</p><p>When we get disappointed, we first and foremost need a fresh encounter with our heavenly Father.</p><p>In another difficult situation we see that He surrounded himself with His three best friends (Matthew 26, 36-38).<br />If we try to understand why God didn’t do anything in a certain situation, our hearts will simply be filled with turmoil and discontent. Only rarely will God answer the question, <span>“</span>Why”.</p><p>But when we submit our will to His will, regardless of what we’ve been through, hold on to how the heavenly Father truly is (how Jesus shows Him to us) and hand over all the rights to full understanding of the situation, the peace of God, which is beyond our comprehension, will come into our hearts (Philippians 4,7).&nbsp;</p><br><br>

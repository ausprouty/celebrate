    Almost all the prophets had <span class="unknown">“</span>desert
    experiences” when they received their calling from God (Luke 3:1-2; 1 Kings
    19:1-16). The desert or solitude was the place where they could focus on
    God.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jesus was led into the desert by the Holy Spirit immediately after His
    baptism. Luke 4:4 shows what happened there: He filled himself with the Word
    of God, reflected on it and received a new perspective about what God was
    doing in His life. His view for his future cleared and He received guidance.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we want to build spiritual movements, we need moments, from time to time,
    to retreat&nbsp;so we can gain new perspectives on how to move forward. The
    gospels often report that Jesus withdrew from the crowd and His disciples.
    The Greek word for desert used in the gospels is
    <span class="unknown">“</span>eremos” and also means
    <span class="unknown">“</span>secluded place”. Before He selected the twelve
    disciples, Jesus also retreated to receive guidance from God.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is important that we plan such retreats to listen to God regularly. A
    good rhythm could be one day a month and several subsequent days a year.

    Here, Jesus gave his disciples some important <span class="unknown">&nbsp;“l</span>ast

  <p>
    In verses 19 and 20, Jesus doesn’t really talk about three steps: make
    disciples, baptise them, teach them. In the Greek original, only one of the
    three has imperative form: <span class="unknown">“</span>make
    disciples”.<span class="unknown">“B</span>aptise” and <span class="unknown">“</span>teach” are
    participles. So the sentence is best translated as: <span class="unknown">“</span>Therefore
    go and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the
    Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey
    everything I have commanded you.” (In English, it is already translated this
    way, so the comment is superfluous; however, other languages – such as
    German – might need this Scripture Comment.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Jesus didn’t call us to establish Bible study groups or any other programs.
    His Commission was to make disciples. So let us always be cautious that our
    meetings aren’t solely about friendly community and personal encouragement,
    but also that they always serve to equip us to go and be envoys in this
    world – for example on our campuses – and make disciples.
  </p>
  <p>
    This could mean to connect them to Jesus in the first place and, if they
    don’t have a relationship with Him yet,&nbsp;to baptise them. Or, if they’re
    followers of Jesus, this could mean to call them out, teach them to walk in
    the dimensions of God’s Kingdom and challenge them to go and make disciples
    themselves (2 Timothy 2:2).

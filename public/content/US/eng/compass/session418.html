      <span>
        Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Go south to the road—the
        desert road—that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.”
      </span>
      <sup class="versenum">27</sup>
      <span>
        So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an
        important official in charge of all the treasury of the Kandake (which
        means “queen of the Ethiopians”). This man had gone to Jerusalem to
        worship,
      </span>
      <sup class="versenum">28</sup>
      <span>
        and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the Book of
        Isaiah the prophet.
      </span>
      <sup class="versenum">29</sup>
      <span>
        The Spirit told Philip, “Go to that chariot and stay near it.”
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">30</sup>Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard
      the man reading Isaiah the prophet. “Do you understand what you are
      reading?” Philip asked.
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">31</sup>“How can I,” he said, “unless someone
      explains it to me?” So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">32</sup>This is the passage of Scripture the eunuch
      was reading:
    </p>
    <div class="poetry top-05">
      <p class="bible">
        “He was led like a sheep to the slaughter,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and
        as a lamb before its shearer is silent,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so
        he did not open his mouth.<br />
        <sup class="versenum">33</sup>In his humiliation he was deprived of
        justice.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can speak of his descendants?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
        his life was taken from the earth.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">34</sup>The eunuch asked Philip, “Tell me, please,
      who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?”<sup class="versenum">
        35
      </sup>Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him
      the good news about Jesus.
    </p>
    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">36</sup>As they traveled along the road, they came
      to some water and the eunuch said, “Look, here is water. What can stand in
      the way of my being baptized?”<sup class="versenum">[37]</sup>
      <sup class="versenum">38</sup>And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then
      both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized
      him.<sup class="versenum">39</sup>When they came up out of the water, the
      Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see
      him again, but went on his way rejoicing.<sup class="versenum">40</sup>Philip,
      however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in
      all the towns until he reached Caesarea.

  <ul>
    <li>
      It may be that you don’t recognise God’s voice because you’re expecting
      something spectacular. But God can speak very softly, such as through a
      simple thought. More often than not, this seems to be the way that God
      speaks. Consider what happened to the Prophet Elijah: God didn’t speak to
      him through a storm as He did to Job (Job 38:1), nor did He speak through
      an earthquake, as He did to the people of Israel (Exodus 19:16-19), nor
      through a fire like He did to Moses, but through a gentle whisper (1 Kings
      19:11-13).&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      If God corrects you, He always speaks about a specific situation. He isn’t
      vague and utters phrases as for example:
      <span class="unknown">“</span>You’re a failure!” But the Holy Spirit
      always shows you if there’s something you should confess before God and
      what exactly it is. This you can then confess and rejoice about His
      forgiveness and His acceptance.
    </li>
    <li>
      God’s voice is always a voice of hope. God’s voice does not
      cause&nbsp;sorrow, unrest or fear about what He tells you. The Holy Spirit
      will lead you through inner comfort if you’re on the right track. But He
      will make you feel uneasy if something is not good for you.
    </li>
    <li>
      God’s voice is reasonable. That doesn’t mean, that it complies with our
      ideas of reason. Because God’s thoughts are
      <span class="unknown">“</span>higher than all human thoughts” (Isaiah
      55:9). But this doesn’t mean that God speaks against all reason.
    </li>
    <li>
      What if God remains silent? God is also a God who remains unseen. There
      will be periods, where God presumably isn’t speaking to us. This also
      belongs to our life here on Earth. In such situations, we should stand
      trustfully on what God has told us so far and what His Word, the Bible,
      tells us.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <span class="normal" />
  </p>
  <p>Basics to hear God’s voice:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Develop a deep and intimate relationship with Jesus.</li>
    <li>
      Inner wounds can keep us from hearing God clearly. Hence live a lifestyle
      of forgiveness.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      Be firmly rooted in the Bible. God’s Word shows us God’s general Will and
      helps us to discern whether something came from Him or whether it was
      another voice (Hebrews 4:12; 1 Thessalonians 5:20-21).
    </li>
    <li>
      Seek and accept help and encouragement from brothers and sisters in Christ
      who have more experience in hearing God’s voice.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>Practice hearing God’s voice (1 Samuel 3:1-10).</li>
    <li>Be a pure vessel (1 Corinthians 6,17-20).</li>
  </ul>

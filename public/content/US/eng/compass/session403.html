Ask Jesus whether there is something that keeps you from fully trusting and following him (e.g. a habit, a false commitment, an attitude, a relationship, a certain way of thinking).&nbsp;Share it with someone in the group right now and give him/her permission to hold you accountable.</p><p>▶&nbsp;Pray in groups of 2-3. Express your devotion to Jesus that you trust him fully also on your campus, university or community. Proclaim that he is your number one priority and that you want to do what he will tell you.</p><p>▶&nbsp;Write down 5 people you want to pray for, so they give their life to Christ and start following him. As a praying aid, write their names on post-it notes and put them on your bathroom mirror, the frigde, etc, or you can write them on a bookmark, set a reminder on your smartphone, etc.</p><p>▶&nbsp;Pray in groups of 2-3 for these people.</p><div class="lesson-section"><img class="lesson-icon" src = "/images/compass/background.png"/><div class="lesson-section-words">SCRIPTURE COMMENTS</div> </div><p>Following Jesus first and foremost requires us to cut all ties to things that keep us from doing that. It means to start a relationship with him, to be with him constantly and to let him form you, to learn from him, to learn how to move in the dimensions of his kingdom. Our “training” as his disciples also has a clear purpose: we should become fishers of men. We are called to connect people to Jesus and make them his disciples as well (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28%3A19-20&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).</p><br /><br />

    Context: Peter and John were teaching a large crowd about the resur-rection
    of Christ. They were arrested and interrogated by the Sanhed-rin because the
    captain of the temple guards and the Sadducees were offended by their
    preaching. After the Sanhedrin threatened them with severe consequences were
    they ever to speak of Jesus again, they were released.

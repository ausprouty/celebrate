        After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi

    Birthday parties, Graduation parties, anniversaries or weddings – all these
    events are great opportunities to invite your friends that don’t know Jesus
    yet, to honor them and to deepen your relationship with them. Matthew got to
    know Jesus and immediately threw a party for his fellow tax collectors. He
    honored them with generosity and gave them an opportunity to get to know
    Jesus and his disciples themselves. Apparently, Jesus was his role model,
    since Jesus ate and celebrated often with people that didn’t conform to
    behavioral standards or even had a shady reputation. Other than with the
    Pharisees and Sadducees,&nbsp; who continuously pointed out their flaws ,
    people felt very comfortable in Jesus’ company. He showed them with
    appreciation by regarding and treating them as beloved sons and daughters of
    God. In such an atmosphere of honor and freedom, people opened up to the
    truth. This in turn lead them to reflect their actions, to repent and start
    over (Luke 19:7-8).

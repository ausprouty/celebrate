    <li>
      In the last few days, did you have the opportunity to share an experience
      with God with someone close to you that doesn’t know Jesus yet? Or could
      you pray for them or help them practically?
    </li>
    <li>Do you need God‘s help in an area of your life?</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="ltr">
    ▶ Pray together: Give thanks for your experiences, ask God for help where
    you need it.
  </p>
  <p class="ltr">
    ▶ Pray together to learn new things about God and that your relationship
    with God deepens and gets stronger.

    <li>
      What are characteristics of a <span class="unknown">“</span>man of the
      spirit”? (read also 2 Corinthians 5:14-15)
    </li>
    <li>
      What are characteristics of a <span class="unknown">“</span>man of the
      flesh”? (1 Corinthians 3:1-3)
    </li>
    <li>
      Where do you still live in the flesh? That is, where do you NOT live in
      unity with and through the power of the Holy Spirit?
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    We Christians may have received the Holy Spirit, but our lives are not
    automatically Spirit-filled (see also the unit “Filled”). But how can we
    live continually in the Holy Spirit?
  </p>
  <p>“Do not quench the Spirit” (1. Thessalonians 5:19)</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Can the Holy Spirit flow freely through you? What could hinder Him?&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      Are you ready to confess to God where you were living in opposition to
      God’s will and to repent from these attitudes, thoughts and deeds? Are you
      ready to submit fully to the guidance of the Holy Spirit and to be
      empowered by him?
    </li>
    <li>
      If you can agree to these points, ask God to fill you with His Holy Spirit
      now. The following two steps can help you. We call them
      <span class="unknown">“</span>spiritual breathing”:
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    ▶&nbsp;If yes, ask God now to fill you with His Spirit. The practical steps
    called “spiritual breathing” you find in the unit “Filled” could be of help.
  </p>
  <p>
    ▶&nbsp;Pray in groups of two or three that your lives are filled with the
    power, love and wisdom of God and that it shines outward to your student
    friends who don’t know Jesus yet.
  </p>
  <p>
    ▶&nbsp;Gather ideas as to how you can support your student friends so that
    they can see/feel/experience Jesus’s love for them in and through you.

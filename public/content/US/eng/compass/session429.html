Churches in the cities had a hard time reaching people with the gospel.</p><p>Columban, Gallus and many other Irish monks were sent by God to central Europe in that time. They travelled in clans and started hundreds of monastery communities within a short period of time. They had a flat hierarchy, were well-connected in a network and greatly affected society through the Kingdom of God. A great sign of distinction was that they brought the perceptible presence of God to the people. <br />What do we mean by <span>“</span>the perceptible presence of God”? There are accounts telling of Columban and how people brought <span>“</span>the sick in&nbsp;droves” to him and that he <span>“</span>healed everyone that came to him from their illness through the remedy of prayer while God’s help was with him”. Through those clan-like communities, whole societies and regions were saturated with the gospel, having a long-lasting effect.</p><p>We want to see today’s society – like the one back then – saturated with God’s Kingdom. Therefore, it is our wish that the SHINE student groups are not just inward-oriented communities. In these groups, we want to be equipped for a lifestyle that shines and acts outwardly together so that our student friends can experience the presence of God. For example, we organise evangelistic parties and invite our friends to them. (See Luke 5:27-32).</p><br /><br />

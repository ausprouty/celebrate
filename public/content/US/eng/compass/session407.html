The satraps were made accountable to them so that the king might not suffer loss.</span><sup class="versenum" >3&nbsp;</sup><span >Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.</span><sup class="versenum" >4&nbsp;</sup><span >At this, the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent.</span><sup class="versenum" >5&nbsp;</sup><span >Finally these men said, “We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his God.”</span></p><p class="bible"><sup class="versenum">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</sup>So these administrators and satraps went as a group to the king and said: “May King Darius live forever!<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</sup>The royal administrators, prefects, satraps, advisers and governors have all agreed that the king should issue an edict and enforce the decree that anyone who prays to any god or human being during the next thirty days, except to you, Your Majesty, shall be thrown into the lions’ den.<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</sup>Now, Your Majesty, issue the decree and put it in writing so that it cannot be altered—in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.”<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</sup>So King Darius put the decree in writing.</p><p class="bible"><sup class="versenum">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</sup>Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before.<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</sup>Then these men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help.<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</sup>So they went to the king and spoke to him about his royal decree: “Did you not publish a decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or human being except to you, Your Majesty, would be thrown into the lions’ den?”</p><p class="bible">The king answered, “The decree stands—in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.”</p><p class="bible"><sup class="versenum">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</sup>Then they said to the king, “Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, Your Majesty, or to the decree you put in writing. He still prays three times a day.”<sup class="versenum">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</sup>When the king heard this, he was greatly distressed; he was determined to rescue Daniel and made every effort until sundown to save him.</p><p class="bible"><sup class="versenum">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</sup>Then the men went as a group to King Darius and said to him, “Remember, Your Majesty, that according to the law of the Medes and Persians no decree or edict that the king issues can be changed.”</p><p class="bible"><sup class="versenum">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</sup>So the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions’ den. The king said to Daniel, “May your God, whom you serve continually, rescue you!”</p><p class="bible"><sup class="versenum">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</sup>A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles, so that Daniel’s situation might not be changed.</p><p class="bible">&nbsp;<a class="bible_readmore" href="https://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%206:1-17&amp;version=TNIV">Read More</a><br /><br /></p></div>

Even at this young age the Babylonian program for re-education did not work on him and his group (see Daniel 1:1-16)! They remained faithful to the God of Israel and His values. The only thing the Babylonians could change were their names: Daniel (<span>“</span>God is my judge”) was named Belteshazzar (<span>“</span>Bel to protect the King”), Mishael (<span>“</span>Who is like God?”) was named Mesach (<span>“</span>Who is like Aku – the God of the moon?”), Hananiah (<span>“</span>God is gracious”) was named Shadrach (<span>“</span>command of Aku”), Asarja (<span>“</span>Jahwe will help”) was named Abed-Nego (<span>“</span>Nebo’s Slave”).</p><p>Where and how do you let yourself be influenced by your environment?</p><br /><br />

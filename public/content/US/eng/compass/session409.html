Tell Him that you trust Him that he provides you (and your heart!) with everything you need (see Psalm 37:3-4 and 1 Peter 5:7). In your prayer tell Him what you need (everyone by themselves).</p><p>▶What concrete steps can you take to bind your heart to God’s Kingdom? Do you need to reset your priorities and, for example, stop doing some&shy;thing (an activity, a commitment, a relationship)? Share in pairs and then pray about it.</p><p>▶&nbsp;Ask the Heavenly Father to reveal&nbsp;to you and your heart more of what He’s like.</p><div class="lesson-section"><img class="lesson-icon" src = "/images/compass/background.png"/><div class="lesson-section-words">SCRIPTURE COMMENTS</div> </div><p>How are we supposed to deal with worries and sorrows? If someone told you right now that you should just stop worrying – would you be able to do so? Presumably, your answer would be <span>“</span>No!”. Worry and sorrow are a matter of the heart and cannot be solved by the mind.</p><p>This is why Jesus first introduces God to us. He calls him <span>“</span>father” and we should call him that, too. First of all, this challenges our human perception of God: The creator of the universe is so good, so much more merciful, loving and closer than we could ever imagine! (Interesting side note: He even delegated the judgement to Jesus, He’s not judging himself! See John 5:22) Jesus challenges us to fully commit to this relationship to the Heavenly Father, to trust Him and to bind us to Him. Only then will our heart come to a rest. What does that mean for us practically?</p><p>▶&nbsp;Continuously proclaim who God is for you over your life (hold fast to how the Bible describes Jesus, or God, respectively).</p><p>▶&nbsp;Full of faith and expectation, ask for what you need rather than worrying about it (Philippians 4:6-7; James 1:5-6).</p><p>▶&nbsp;Make His Kingdom your first priority and invest your treasures (time, energy, money) in that Kingdom. Read Luke 12:32-34.</p><br><br>

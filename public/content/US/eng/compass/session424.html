        Whatever mission Saul sent him on, David was so successful that Saul
        gave him a high rank in the army. This pleased all the troops, and
        Saul’s officers as well.

    <p class="bible">
      <sup class="versenum">6</sup>When the men were returning home after David
      had killed the Philistine, the women came out from all the towns of Israel
      to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful songs and with
      timbrels and lyres.<sup class="versenum">7</sup>As they danced, they sang:

      close eye on David.

  <p>
    Comparison can easily lead to uncertainty and cause us to feel inferior to
    others. Our self-esteem diminishes continuously. We distrust others and
    cannot celebrate their success because we are subconsciously driven by our
    own ambitions, by jealousy and our competitiveness. In all this, we forget
    to listen to God and try with all means available to keep up and gain more.
  </p>
  <p>
    The origin of comparison lies in distrusting God. Distrusting that He
    created you wonderfully and unique, distrusting that He put a calling on
    your life that you can discover and grow into. An attitude of constant
    comparison shows a lack of trust in God. But the more God’s truth and
    thoughts about your life starts to shape you and your thinking, the less you
    are susceptible to comparative thinking.

  <p>
    Which of the following phrases about your new identity (God‘s truth and
    thoughts about your life) sticks out for you?
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I am Christ‘s friend (John 15,15)</li>
    <li>I am born of God and the evil one cannot touch me (1 John 5,18)</li>
    <li>
      I have not been given a spirit of fear, but of power, love and
      self-discipline (2 Timothy 1,7)
    </li>
    <li>I am God‘s co-worker (2 Corinthians 6,1)</li>
    <li>I am secure (Ephesians 2,20)</li>
    <li>I am not alone (Hebrews 13,5)</li>
    <li>I am chosen and clearly loved (Colossians 53,12)</li>

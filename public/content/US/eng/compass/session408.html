Build groups of two to three and pray for open doors at your institute to talk about faith and to share the gospel. Pray for your non-Christian friends: pray for possibilities to share with them your experiences with Jesus and for possibilities to pray with them so that they can experience God for themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>▶&nbsp;Think about starting to meet in groups of two or three to pray for your&shy; friends and your university.</p><div class="lesson-section"><img class="lesson-icon" src = "/images/compass/background.png"/><div class="lesson-section-words">SCRIPTURE COMMENTS</div> </div><p>One Saturday morning, Bill Bright was alone on his knees in his office, praying for an urgent need the ministry had over $485. He heard a knock at the door; it was the postman, carrying a registered letter.<br /><span>“</span>It’s a good thing you were here,” the postman said, <span>“</span>or I wouldn’t have been able to leave this letter.”</p><p>Bill signed for it and went back into his office where, <span>“</span>while I was praying, God suggested I open the letter”. Inside he found $500 sent from Zurich, Switzerland,&nbsp;by a couple whose entire family had become Christians through Bill’s ministry when they were in California. They wrote that they simply wanted to express their appreciation for what God was doing in and through their lives as a result of Bill’s ministry. The $485 need was met.</p><p>From: Amazing Faith, The authorized Biography of Bill Bright, by Michael Richardson, 2000, Page 105.</p><br><br>

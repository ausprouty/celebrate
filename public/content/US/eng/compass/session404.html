What would your Christian friends say?</li></ol><p>Jesus promises us that the Holy Spirit will flow like a river of living waters from our lives if we believe (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+7%3A37-39&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank">John 7:37-39</a>).&nbsp; We received the Holy Spirit when we became followers of Jesus but we are not automatically filled. Similar to a fire dwindling in oxygen-deprived air, the Holy Spirit can be quenched by <span>“</span>bad air”, such as unrepented sin we keep in our lives. <span>“</span>Do not quench the Spirit”, Paul writes in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+5%3A19&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank">1 Thessalonians 5:19</a>.</p><ol><li>How can the Holy Spirit flow freely through you?

The following two steps can help you with that. We call them “spiritual breathing”:</p><p>▶&nbsp;Similar to biological breathing, exhale “bad air”. Get rid of the stinking air that inhibits the fire: Confess to God where you acted and thought contrary to His will (whatever springs to mind). Submit yourself fully and anew to the guidance of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>▶&nbsp;Inhale “fresh air”: Ask God to fill and empower you anew with the Holy Spirit.</p><p><span style="font-size: 15.008px;">This could be your prayer: <span>“</span>Holy Spirit, please fill me anew, take over control of every area of my life. I decide to trust you and listen to you”.</span></p><ol><li>You can <span>“</span>breathe spiritually” any time. You won’t feel completely different after every spiritual breath. Even though emotions are important, they don’t define what is true. Therefore it is wise to trust God and His promise to renew you if you ask for it, even if you <span>“</span>don’t feel that way”.</li></ol><div class="lesson-section"><img class="lesson-icon" src = "/images/compass/background.png"/><div class="lesson-section-words">SCRIPTURE COMMENTS</div> </div><p>V.18-21 are one sentence in the Greek original: <span>“</span>Be (continuously) filled by the Holy spirit, speaking to one another ... sing ... give thanks ... and submit to one another.” V. 19-21 are specific actions you can take to position yourself to be filled by the Holy Spirit.</p><p>The Holy Spirit helps us to recognise God and to understand the Bible (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+2%2C14-16&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 2:14-16</a>).

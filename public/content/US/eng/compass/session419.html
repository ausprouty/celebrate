      Why did Jesus call the 12 disciples? List all the aspects you find in the
      scripture.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      Consider the sequence these aspects appear. What comes first and
      why?&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>Jesus calls everyone by name. What does that mean for you?</li>
    <li>
      Following Jesus means, first of all, to have a close relationship with
      Him. Are you close to Jesus, or do you need to let Jesus to get close to
      your heart again? Is there something standing between you and Jesus that
      you should confess to Him? (Everyone do this on their own.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Jesus didn’t invest his life in everyone. He influenced the masses and had
      lots of other disciples (Luke 6:17), but most of His time He deliberately
      invested exclusively in just twelve people. These He made his disciples,
      these He called his friends, with them He shared His heart; they were
      twelve who <span class="unknown">“</span>knew the Father”. He knew that to
      change the world He needed only a few people, but those few must be 100%
      committed to Him and are ready to be sent. Are you 100% committed and
      ready to be an envoy for Jesus?
    </li>
    <li>What is our mandate as envoys? (see also John 17:18)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>▶&nbsp;Pray together and make yourselves available as envoys.</p>
  <p>
    ▶&nbsp;Ask God to fill you fully with His Holy Spirit (you can find
    practical steps for that in the “Filled” unit).

  <p>
    In the Bible, 12 is a symbol for completion as well as for the 12 tribes of
    Israel. While walking on Earth, Jesus focused on 12 Jewish men. But after
    his resurrection, he sent out his disciples to make disciples of all
    nations, to bring people into a relationship with Jesus and to equip and
    authorise them as envoys as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    In earlier times, an envoy did not necessarily need to be a person of high
    estate, he could also be a servant or a slave. His
    <span class="unknown">“</span>natural” estate did not matter, because the
    recipient or negotiating party did not view him as a servant or slave, but
    as a carrier of the king’s full authority (within the concerned matter). For
    example, he distributed royal decrees, negotiated and finalised contracts
    with other parties. In everything he did, he spoke the king’s words and
    acted, just as the king acted himself. What an envoy did was binding. Hence,
    envoys carried the king’s seal, which was necessary to negotiate and
    finalise contracts.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the same way, Jesus calls us today to be His envoys, who are in
    relationship with Him. Jesus is our King and we are His envoys, endowed with
    all His authority. The Holy Spirit is our seal. He provides us with the
    spiritual authority of Jesus and signifies to the spiritual realm that we
    are acting on behalf of King Jesus. This means: As soon as we act or speak
    in accordance to Him, it has the same effect as if Jesus were acting or
    speaking himself!
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="unknown">“</span>It is time to live and think supernaturally
    and do mighty things for the Lord. There is no limit to what our almighty
    God can accomplish through us in the power of the Holy Spirit.” (Bill
    Bright)

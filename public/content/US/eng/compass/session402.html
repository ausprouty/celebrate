      After 40 years in the desert, the people of Israel are about to cross the
      river Jordan and conquer the Promised Land. God keeps His promise and they
      obtain their land. Where have you experienced God keeping His promises?
      Give thanks for specific experiences.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      Are you facing new ground as well? What do you need from God (to conquer
      it)? What does He promise you in His word? What is your responsibility for
      these promises to become true (see Joshua 1)?

      What does God’s challenge in Joshua 1:8 (“Keep this Book of the Law always

    ▶ Everyone chose two or three verses that are particularly encouraging. Take
    these promises into prayer and proclaim them over your life (share aloud in

  <ul>
    <li>
      Jews read the Bible out loud, because they believe that the Word should
      not stop coming from their lips (in reference to Joshua 1:8).&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      The Old Testament is referred to as “the Law” (see, for example,
      <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+12%3A5&amp;version=NIV"
        target="_blank"
        >Matthew 12:5</a
      >
      and
      <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+10%3A34&amp;version=NIV"
        target="_blank"
        >John 10:34</a
      >).&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      God’s word does not solely consist of words, but it always contains the
      reality of His kingdom. It contains transformational power (<a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+4%3A12&amp;version=NIV"
        target="_blank"
        >Hebrews 4:12</a
      >)! Jesus compares the Word of God to seed (<a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+8%3A15&amp;version=NIV"
        target="_blank"
        >Luke 8:15</a
      >) – If we hear it (that is, from our own lips!) and hold on to it with
      perseverance, it will bring fruit. This means it will release faith,
      certainty, power and God’s plan in our life!&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      You can practice holding on to God’s word the following way: In the
      following days, read aloud the verses you wrote down that encourage you.

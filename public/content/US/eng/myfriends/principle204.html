      <p>
        <sup>37</sup>On the last and greatest day of the
        festival, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, “Let anyone who is
        thirsty come to me and drink.<sup >38</sup
        >Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water
        will flow from within them.”<sup >39</sup>By
        this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to
        receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had
        not yet been glorified.

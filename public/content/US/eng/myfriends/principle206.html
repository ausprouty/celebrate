      <p>
        <sup>34</sup>When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd,
        he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a
        shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >35</sup>By this time it was late in the
        day, so his disciples came to him. “This is a remote place,” they said,
        “and it’s already very late.<sup >36</sup>Send
        the people away so that they can go to the surrounding countryside and
        villages and buy themselves something to eat.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >37</sup>But he answered, “You give them
        something to eat.”
      </p>
      <p>
        They said to him, “That would take more than half a year’s wages! Are we
        to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >38</sup>“How many loaves do you have?”
        he asked. “Go and see.”
      </p>
      <p>When they found out, they said, “Five—and two fish.”</p>
      <p>
        <sup >39</sup>Then Jesus directed them to have
        all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.<sup
          
          >40</sup
        >So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.<sup
          
          >41</sup
        >Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he
        gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to
        distribute to the people. He also divided the two fish among them
        all.<sup >42</sup>They all ate and were
        satisfied,<sup >43</sup>and the disciples
        picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish.<sup
          
          >44</sup
        >The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.

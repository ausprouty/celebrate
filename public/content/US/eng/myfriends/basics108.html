      Although through Jesus‘ suffering, death and resurrection all sins of all
      people of all time can be forgiven, it does not mean that since sins are
      just forgiven automatically. Jesus created the possibility for forgiveness
      which we can now use.&nbsp;

    <li>
      Which two things do we have to do for our sins to be forgiven?&nbsp;
      &nbsp;(1. Ask God for forgiveness, 2. Forgive other people)

      &nbsp;When God forgives us, it means that he no longer charges us with
      guilt That is possible now because Jesus suffered and died for us. He took
      the&nbsp; consequences of our sins which we should have&nbsp;suffered
      ourselves so that we can become free.&nbsp; On the basis of this fact, God
      no longer charges us&nbsp; with guilt, although we are guilty, pardoning
      us instead. Although we are actually guilty we are declared righteous by
      God. And that forms the basis for our reconciliation with God. What a
      privilege!
    </li>
    <li>
      When we forgive people who have sinned against us, it does not mean that
      we forget, deny or gloss over what happened. In this context “forgiving”
      means letting go. We can hand over the whole thing to God for him to deal
      with it. And God will not just forget it but deal with it in his perfect
      way. No longer do we have to get our own back, instead we can confidently
      leave it to God, for he says “It is mine to avenge, I will repay”
      (Deuteronomy 32:35 / Romans 12:19). We need to leave the way in which God
      does that up to him. For God‘s ways and thoughts are higher than ours
      (Isaiah 55:9).&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      &nbsp;When we forgive someone and thus hand the whole thing over to God,
      we and our relationship with that person are freed from the burden of that
      sin. We no longer need to bear a grudge. Instead we are able to live
      unburdened and interact with that person because there is no longer any
      guilt between us.

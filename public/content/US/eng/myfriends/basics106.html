        <sup>13</sup>See, my servant will act wisely;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he
        will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted.<br />
        <sup >14</sup>Just as there were many who were
        appalled at him—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his appearance was so
        disfigured beyond that of any human being<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and
        his form marred beyond human likeness—<br />
        <sup >15</sup>so he will sprinkle many
        nations,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and kings will shut their mouths
        because of him.<br />For what they were not told, they will see,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and
        what they have not heard, they will understand

        <sup>53:1</sup>Who has believed our message<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and
        to whom has the arm of the
        <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
        been revealed?<br />
        <sup >2</sup>He grew up before him like a
        tender shoot,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and like a root out of dry
        ground.<br />He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing
        in his appearance that we should desire him.<br />
        <sup >3</sup>He was despised and rejected by
        mankind,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a man of suffering, and familiar
        with pain.<br />Like one from whom people hide their faces<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he
        was despised, and we held him in low esteem.
      </p>
      <div class="myfriends-poetry top-05">
        <p>
          <sup >4</sup>Surely he took up our pain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and
          bore our suffering,<br />yet we considered him punished by God,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stricken
          by him, and afflicted.<br />
          <sup >5</sup>But he was pierced for our
          transgressions,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was crushed for our
          iniquities;<br />the punishment that brought us peace was on him,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and
          by his wounds we are healed.<br />
          <sup >6</sup>We all, like sheep, have gone
          astray,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each of us has turned to our own
          way;<br />and the
          <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
          has laid on him<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the iniquity of us all.

          slaughter,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as a sheep before its
          shearers is silent,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so he did not open
          his mouth.<br />
          <sup >8</sup>By oppression and judgment he
          was taken away.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet who of his generation
          protested?<br />For he was cut off from the land of the living;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for
          the transgression of my people he was punished.<br />
          <sup >9</sup>He was assigned a grave with
          the wicked,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with the rich in his
          death,<br />though he had done no violence,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor

          <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
          makes his life an offering for sin,<br />he will see his offspring and

          <sup >12</sup>Therefore I will give him a
          portion among the great,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will
          divide the spoils with the strong,<br />because he poured out his life
          unto death,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and was numbered with the
          transgressors.<br />For he bore the sin of many,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and
          made intercession for the transgressors.

        <p>
          <sup>29</sup>The next day John saw Jesus coming
          toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of
          the world!<sup >30</sup>This is the one I
          meant when I said, ‘A man who comes after me has surpassed me because
          he was before me.’<sup >31</sup>I myself did
          not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he
          might be revealed to Israel.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup >32</sup>Then John gave this testimony:
          “I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.<sup >
            33
          </sup>And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to
          baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit come
          down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’<sup >
            34
          </sup>I have seen and I testify that this is God’s Chosen One.”

          Last time we read about God announcing a new age. Today we will learn
          about how this is to come about (a practical plan). God will send “his
          servant”. That means a man who will live exactly as God wants us to.
          Despite committing no sin or wrong, this man will die like a criminal.
          For the mission of God‘s servant will be to take humankind‘s sickness,
          pain and sin upon himself. This will not be a pretty sight, quite the
          opposite.

          The people around him will despise and turn away from him. They will
          think that he is a criminal who is being punished by God for his awful
          deeds. But really he will not be punished for what he himself did, but
          for what all humans under the influence of evil have done. This
          servant of God will take the responsibility for our wrong doing. He
          will be executed instead of us sinful people so we can have peace
          again; peace with God and peace with others.

        <p>John 1:29-34</p>
        <p>
          John (the Baptist) was a prophet who was sent by God to prepare Israel
          for the coming of his servant (read Isaiah 52-53). In this passage he
          identifies Jesus as the Lamb of God, who takes the sins of the world
          upon himself. In other words, John is saying that Jesus is the long
          awaited Savior who will free humanity from the power of evil. To do
          that he will take humanity‘s sins upon himself and take the punishment
          for them.

In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p><p><sup class="myfriends-myfriends_versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters.<sup class="myfriends-myfriends_versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.<sup class="myfriends-myfriends_versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>(The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also there.)<sup class="myfriends-myfriends_versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush.<sup class="myfriends-myfriends_versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur.

Humans have had an important role since the beginning. The animals were created so humans wouldn‘t be alone and the sexes (male and female) were created to make an extremely intimate form of union possible. The trust between the two was so great that they were in no way ashamed of their nakedness and didn‘t need to hide or protect themselves behind clothes.</div><div class="myfriends-background-text">&nbsp;</div></div><div class="myfriends-background-text"><div class="myfriends-background-text">Strikingly, humans were given the option of disobeying God by eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. But God warned them that the punishment for doing so would be death. The existence of that tree clearly shows us that humans aren‘t completely at the mercy of God‘s will. Quite the opposite, humankind had the freedom of choice. They were given the freedom of choice to accept or reject God‘s love.</div><p>&nbsp;</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div><div id="completed" style="font-size: 13.008px;">&nbsp;</div><div class="myfriends-lesson-section" style="font-size: 13.008px;">&nbsp;</div><p class="myfriends-lesson_end" style="font-size: 13.008px;">&nbsp;</p><p style="font-size: 13.008px;">&nbsp;</p>

        <sup class="myfriends-versenum">1&nbsp;</sup>Jesus entered Jericho and
        was passing through.<sup class="myfriends-versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>A man
        was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was
        wealthy.<sup class="myfriends-versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>He wanted to see
        who Jesus was, but because he was short he could not see over the
        crowd.<sup class="myfriends-versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>So he ran ahead and
        climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup class="myfriends-versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>When Jesus reached the
        spot, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I
        must stay at your house today.”<sup class="myfriends-versenum"
          >6&nbsp;</sup
        >So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup class="myfriends-versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>All the people saw this and
        began to mutter, “He has gone to be the guest of a sinner.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup class="myfriends-versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>But Zacchaeus stood up and
        said to the Lord, “Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my
        possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything,
        I will pay back four times the amount.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup class="myfriends-versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said to him, “Today
        salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of
        Abraham.<sup class="myfriends-versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>For the Son of Man
        came to seek and to save the lost.”
